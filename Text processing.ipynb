SADI CARNOT\\n\\nPRESIDENT SADI CARNOT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMY FIRST YEARS AS A FRENCHWOMAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nWHEN MACMAHON WAS PRESIDENT\\n\\nI was married in Paris in November, 1874, at the French Protestant\\nChapel of the rue Taitbout, by Monsieur Bersier, one of the ablest and\\nmost eloquent pastors of the Protestant church. We had just established\\nourselves in Paris, after having lived seven years in Rome. We had a\\nvague idea of going back to America, and Paris seemed a first step in\\nthat direction--was nearer New York than Rome. I knew very little of\\nFrance--we had never lived there--merely stayed a few weeks in the\\nspring and autumn, coming and going from Italy. My husband was a deputy,\\nnamed to the National Assembly in Bordeaux in 1871, by his\\nDepartment--the Aisne. He had some difficulty in getting to Bordeaux.\\nCommunications and transports were not easy, as the Germans were still\\nin the country, and, what was more important, he hadn\\'t any\\nmoney--couldn\\'t correspond with his banker, in Paris--(he was living in\\nthe country). However, a sufficient amount was found in the country, and\\nhe was able to make his journey. When I married, the Assembly was\\nsitting at Versailles. Monsieur Thiers, the first President of the\\nRepublic, had been overthrown in May, 1873--Marshal MacMahon named in\\nhis place. W.[1] had had a short ministry (public instruction) under\\nMonsieur Thiers, but he was so convinced that it would not last that he\\nnever even went to the ministry--saw his directors in his own rooms. I\\nwas plunged at once into absolutely new surroundings. W.\\'s personal\\nfriends were principally Orleanists and the literary element of\\nParis--his colleagues at the Institute. The first houses I was taken to\\nin Paris were the Segurs, Remusats, Lasteyries, Casimir Periers,\\nGallieras, d\\'Haussonville, Leon Say, and some of the Protestant\\nfamilies--Pourtales, Andre Bartholdi, Mallet, etc. It was such an\\nentirely different world from any I had been accustomed to that it took\\nme some time to feel at home in my new milieu. Political feeling was\\nvery strong--all sorts of fresh, young elements coming to the front.\\nThe Franco-German War was just over--the French very sore and bitter\\nafter their defeat. There was a strong underlying feeling of violent\\nanimosity to the Emperor, who had lost them two of their fairest\\nprovinces, and a passionate desire for the revanche. The feeling was\\nvery bitter between the two branches of the Royalist party, Legitimists\\nand Orleanists. One night at a party in the Faubourg St. Germain, I saw\\na well-known fashionable woman of the extreme Legitimist party turn her\\nback on the Comtesse de Paris. The receptions and visits were not always\\neasy nor pleasant, even though I was a stranger and had no ties with any\\nformer government. I remember one of my first visits to a well-known\\nLegitimist countess in the Faubourg St. Germain; I went on her reception\\nday, a thing all young women are most particular about in Paris. I found\\nher with a circle of ladies sitting around her, none of whom I knew.\\nThey were all very civil, only I was astonished at the way the mistress\\nof the house mentioned my name every time she spoke to me: \"Madame\\nWaddington, etes-vous allee a l\\'Opera hier soir,\" \"Madame Waddington,\\nvous montez a cheval tous les matins, je crois,\" \"Monsieur Waddington va\\ntous les vendredis a l\\'Institut, il me semble,\" etc. I was rather\\nsurprised and said to W. when I got home, \"How curious it is, that way\\nof saying one\\'s name all the time; I suppose it is an old-fashioned\\nFrench custom. Madame de B. must have said \\'Waddington\\' twenty times\\nduring my rather short visit.\" He was much amused. \"Don\\'t you know why?\\nSo that all the people might know who you were and not say awful things\\nabout the \\'infecte gouvernement\\' and the Republic, \\'which no gentleman\\ncould serve.\\'\"\\n\\n[Footnote 1: \"W.,\" here and throughout this book, refers to Madame\\nWaddington\\'s husband, M. William Waddington.]\\n\\n[Illustration: Monsieur Theirs.]\\n\\nThe position of the German Embassy in Paris was very difficult, and\\nunfortunately their first ambassador after the war, Count Arnim, didn\\'t\\nunderstand (perhaps didn\\'t care to) how difficult it was for a\\nhigh-spirited nation, which until then had always ranked as a great\\nmilitary power, to accept her humiliation and be just to the victorious\\nadversary. Arnim was an unfortunate appointment--not at all the man for\\nsuch a delicate situation. We had known him in Rome in the old days of\\nPio Nono\\'s reign, where he had a great position as Prussian minister to\\nthe Vatican. He and the Countess Arnim received a great deal, and their\\nbeautiful rooms in the Palazzo Caffarelli, on the top of the Capitol\\nHill (the two great statues of Castor and Pollux standing by their\\nhorses looking as if they were guarding the entrance) were a brilliant\\ncentre for all the Roman and diplomatic world. He was a thorough man of\\nthe world, could make himself charming when he chose, but he never had a\\npleasant manner, was curt, arrogant, with a very strong sense of his own\\nsuperiority. From the first moment he came to Paris as ambassador, he\\nput people\\'s backs up. They never liked him, never trusted him; whenever\\nhe had an unpleasant communication to make, he exaggerated the\\nunpleasantness, never attenuated, and there is so much in the way things\\nare said. The French were very hard upon him when he got into trouble,\\nand certainly his own Government was merciless to him.\\n\\nOne of my first small difficulties after becoming a Frenchwoman was to\\neliminate some of my German friends from my salon. I could not run the\\nrisk of their being treated rudely. I remember so well one night at\\nhome, before I was married, seeing two French officers not in uniform\\nslip quietly out of the room when one of the German Embassy came in, yet\\nours was a neutral house. When my engagement was announced one of my\\ngreat friends at the German Embassy (Count Arco) said to me: \"This is\\nthe end, I suppose, of our friendship; I can never go to see you when\\nyou are the wife of a French deputy.\" \"Oh, yes, you can still come; not\\nquite so often, perhaps, but I can\\'t give up my friends.\" However, we\\ndrifted apart without knowing why exactly. It is curious how long that\\nhostile feeling toward Germany has lasted in France.\\n\\nEvery year there is a great review of the Paris garrison (thirty\\nthousand men) by the President of the Republic, at Longchamp, on the\\n14th of July, the national fete--the day of the storming of the Bastile.\\nIt is a great day in Paris--one of the sights of the year--and falling\\nin midsummer the day is generally beautiful and very warm. From early\\ndawn all the chairs and benches along the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne are\\ncrowded with people waiting patiently for hours to see the show. There\\nis not a seat to be had at Longchamp. Unless one arrives very early the\\ntribunes are packed, and the President\\'s box very crowded, as he invites\\nthe diplomatic corps and the ministers and their wives on that day. The\\ntroops are always received with much enthusiasm, particularly the\\nartillery, dragging their light field-pieces and passing at a\\ngallop--also the battalion of St. Cyr, the great French military school.\\nThe final charge of the cavalry is very fine. Masses of riders come\\nthundering over the plain, the general commanding in front, stopping\\nsuddenly as if moved by machinery, just opposite the President\\'s box.\\nI went very regularly as long as W. was in office, and always enjoyed my\\nday. There was an excellent buffet in the salon behind the box, and it\\nwas pleasant to have a cup of tea and rest one\\'s eyes while the long\\ncolumns of infantry were passing--the regular, continuous movement was\\nfatiguing. All the ambassadors and foreigners were very keen about the\\nreview, paying great attention to the size of the men and horses and\\ntheir general equipment. As long as Marshal MacMahon was President of\\nthe Republic, he always rode home after the review down the\\nChamps-Elysees--in full uniform, with a brilliant staff of foreign\\nofficers and military attaches. It was a pretty sight and attracted\\ngreat attention. Some of the foreign uniforms are very striking and the\\nFrench love a military show.\\n\\n[Illustration: Marshal MacMahon.]\\n\\nFor many years after the war the German military attache returned from\\nthe review unobserved in a _shut_ carriage, couldn\\'t run the risk of an\\nangry or insulting word from some one in the crowd, and still later,\\nfifteen years after the war, when W. was ambassador in England, I was\\ngodmother of the daughter of a German-English cousin living in London.\\nThe godfather was Count Herbert Bismarck, son of the famous chancellor.\\nAt the time of the christening I was in France, staying with some\\nfriends in the country. The son of the house had been through the war,\\nhad distinguished himself very much, and they were still very sore over\\ntheir reverses and the necessity of submitting to all the little\\npin-pricks which came at intervals from Germany. Bismarck sent me a\\ntelegram regretting the absence of the godmother from the ceremony. It\\nwas brought to me just after breakfast, while we were having our coffee.\\nI opened it and read it out, explaining that it was from Bismarck to\\nexpress his regret for my absence. There was a dead silence, and then\\nthe mistress of the house said to me: \"C\\'est tres desagreable pour vous,\\nchere amie, cette association avec Bismarck.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t see much of W. in the daytime. We usually rode in the morning\\nin the Bois and immediately after breakfast he started for Versailles in\\nthe parliamentary train. Dinner was always a doubtful meal. Sometimes he\\ncame home very late for nine-o\\'clock dinner; sometimes he dined at\\nVersailles and only got home at ten or eleven if the sitting was stormy.\\nThe Hotel des Reservoirs did a flourishing business as long as the\\nChambers sat at Versailles. When we were dining out it was very\\ndisagreeable, particularly the first winter when I didn\\'t know many\\npeople. I remember one dinner at the Countess Duchatel\\'s where I went\\nalone; we were ten women and five men. All the rest were deputies, who\\nhad telegraphed at the last moment they would not come, were kept at\\nVersailles by an important question.\\n\\nOne of the most interesting things I saw in 1873, just before my\\nmarriage, was the court-martial of Marshal Bazaine for treachery at\\nMetz--giving up his army and the city without any attempt to break\\nthrough the enemy\\'s lines, or in fact any resistance of any kind. The\\ncourt was held at the Grand Trianon, Versailles, a place so associated\\nwith a pleasure-loving court, and the fanciful devices of a gay young\\nqueen, that it was difficult to realise the drama that was being\\nenacted, when the honour of a Marshal of France--almost an army of\\nFrance, was to be judged. It was an impressive scene, the hall packed,\\nand people at all the doors and entrances clamouring for seats. The\\npublic was curious, a little of everything--members of the National\\nAssembly, officers all in uniform, pretty women of all categories--the\\ngroup of journalists with keen eager faces watching every change of\\nexpression of the marshal\\'s face--some well-known faces, wives of\\nmembers or leading political and literary men, a fair amount of the\\nfrailer sisterhood, actresses and demi-mondaines, making a great effect\\nof waving plumes and diamonds. The court was presided over by the Duc\\nd\\'Aumale, who accepted the office after much hesitation. He was a fine,\\nsoldierly figure as he came in, in full uniform, a group of officers\\nbehind him, all with stern, set faces. The impression of the public was\\ngenerally hostile to the marshal; one felt it all through the trial. He\\nwas dressed in full uniform, with the grand cordon of the Legion of\\nHonour. It was melancholy to hear the report of his career when it was\\nread by his counsel,--long years of active service, many wounds, often\\nmentioned for brave conduct under fire, having the \"Medaille\\nMilitaire\"--the grand cordon of the Legion d\\'Honneur, the baton de\\nMarechal de France,--all the honours his country could give him--to end\\nso miserably, judged not only by the court but by the country, as a\\ntraitor, false to his trust, when his country was in the death-throes of\\ndefeat and humiliation. His attitude at the trial was curious. He sat\\nvery still in his armchair, looking straight before him, only raising\\nhis head and looking at the Duc d\\'Aumale when some grave accusation was\\nmade against him. His explanation brought the famous reply from the duc,\\nwhen he said it was impossible to act or to treat; there was nothing\\nleft in France--no government, no orders--nothing. The due answered:\\n\"Il y avait toujours la France.\" He didn\\'t look overwhelmed, rather like\\nsome one who was detached from the whole proceedings. I saw his face\\nquite well; it was neither false nor weak--ordinary. It is difficult to\\nbelieve that a French general with a brilliant record behind him should\\nhave been guilty of such treachery, sacrificing his men and his honour.\\nHis friends (they were not many) say he lost his head, was nearly crazy\\nwith the utterly unforeseen defeat of the French, but even a moment of\\ninsanity would hardly account for such extraordinary weakness. W. and\\nsome of his friends were discussing it in the train coming home. They\\nwere all convinced of his guilt, had no doubt as to what the sentence of\\nthe court would be--death and degradation--but thought that physical\\nfatigue and great depression must have caused a general breakdown. The\\nend every one knows. He was condemned to be shot and degraded. The first\\npart of the sentence was cancelled on account of his former services,\\nbut he was degraded, imprisoned, escaped, and finished his life in Spain\\nin poverty and obscurity, deserted by all his friends and his wife. It\\nwas a melancholy rentree for the Duc d\\'Aumale. His thoughts must have\\ngone back to the far-off days when the gallant young officer, fils de\\nFrance, won his first military glory in Algiers, and thought the world\\nwas at his feet. His brilliant exploit, capturing the Smala of\\nAbd-el-Kader, has been immortalised by Vernet in the great historical\\npicture that one sees at Versailles. There are always artists copying\\nparts of it, particularly one group, where a lovely, fair-haired woman\\nis falling out of a litter backward. Even now, when one thinks of the\\nKing Louis Philippe, with all his tall, strong, young sons (there is a\\nwell-known picture of the King on horseback with all his sons around\\nhim--splendid specimens of young manhood), it seems incredible that they\\nare not still ruling and reigning at the Tuileries. I wonder if things\\nwould have been very different if Louis Philippe and his family had not\\nwalked out of the Tuileries that day!\\n\\nI often asked W. in what way France had gained by being a republic. I\\npersonally was quite impartial, being born an American and never having\\nlived in France until after the Franco-Prussian War. I had no particular\\nties nor traditions, had no grandfather killed on the scaffold, nor\\nfrozen to death in the retreat of \"La Grande Armee\" from Moscow. They\\nalways told me a republic was in the air--young talents and energy must\\ncome to the front--the people must have a voice in the government. I\\nthink the average Frenchman is intelligent, but I don\\'t think the vote\\nof the man in the street can have as much value as that of a man who has\\nhad not only a good education but who has been accustomed always to hear\\ncertain principles of law and order held up as rules for the guidance of\\nhis own life as well as other people\\'s. Certainly universal suffrage was\\na most unfortunate measure to take from America and apply to France, but\\nit has been taken and now must stay. I have often heard political men\\nwho deplored and condemned the law say that no minister would dare to\\npropose a change.\\n\\nI went often to the Chamber in the spring--used to drive out and bring\\nW. home. Versailles was very animated and interesting during all that\\ntime, so many people always about. Quite a number of women followed the\\ndebates. One met plenty of people one knew in the streets, at the\\nPatissiers, or at some of the bric-a-brac shops, where there were still\\nbargains to be found in very old furniture, prints, and china. There is\\na large garrison. There were always officers riding, squads of soldiers\\nmoving about, bugle-calls in all directions, and continuous arrivals at\\nthe station of deputies and journalists hurrying to the palace, their\\nblack portfolios under their arms. The palace was cold. There was a fine\\ndraught at the entrance and the big stone staircase was always cold,\\neven in June, but the assembly-room was warm enough and always crowded.\\nIt was rather difficult to get seats. People were so interested in those\\nfirst debates after the war, when everything had to be reorganised and\\nso much of the past was being swept away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY AT VERSAILLES\\n\\nThe sittings of the assembly were very interesting in that wonderful\\nyear when everything was being discussed. All public interest of course\\nwas centred in Versailles, where the National Assembly was trying to\\nestablish some sort of stable government. There were endless discussions\\nand speeches and very violent language in the Chambers. Gambetta made\\nsome bitter attacks on the Royalists, accusing them of mauvaise foi and\\nwant of patriotism. The Bonapartist leaders tried to persuade themselves\\nand their friends that they still had a hold on the country and that a\\nplebiscite would bring back in triumph their prince. The Legitimists,\\nhoping against hope that the Comte de Chambord would still be the\\nsaviour of the country, made passionate appeals to the old feeling of\\nloyalty in the nation, and the centre droit, representing the\\nOrleanists, nervous, hesitating, knowing the position perfectly,\\nardently desiring a constitutional monarchy, but feeling that it was\\nnot possible at that moment, yet unwilling to commit themselves to a\\nfinal declaration of the Republic, which would make a Royalist\\nrestoration impossible. All the Left confident, determined.\\n\\nThe Republic was voted on the 30th of January, 1875, by a majority of\\none vote, if majority it could be called, but the great step had been\\ntaken, and the struggle began instantly between the moderate\\nconservative Republicans and the more advanced Left. W. came home late\\nthat day. Some of his friends came in after dinner and the talk was most\\ninteresting. I was so new to it all that most of the names of the rank\\nand file were unknown to me, and the appreciations of the votes and the\\nanecdotes and side-lights on the voters said nothing to me. Looking back\\nafter all these years, it seems to me that the moderate Royalists\\n(centre droit) threw away a splendid chance. They could not stop the\\nRepublican wave (nothing could) but they might have controlled it and\\ndirected it instead of standing aloof and throwing the power into the\\nhands of the Left. We heard the well-known sayings very often those\\ndays: \"La Republique sera conservatrice ou elle ne sera pas\" and \"La\\nRepublique sans Republicains,\" attributed to M. Thiers and Marshal\\nMacMahon. The National Assembly struggled on to the end of the year,\\nmaking a constitution, a parliament with two houses, senate and chamber\\nof deputies, with many discussions and contradictions, and hopes and\\nillusions.\\n\\n[Illustration: Sitting of the National Assembly at the palace of\\nVersailles. From _l\\'Illustration_, March 11, 1876]\\n\\nI went often to Versailles, driving out when the weather was fine. I\\nliked the stormy sittings best. Some orator would say something that\\ndispleased the public, and in a moment there would be the greatest\\nuproar, protestations and accusations from all sides, some of the\\nextreme Left getting up, gesticulating wildly, and shaking their fists\\nat the speaker--the Right, generally calm and sarcastic, requesting the\\nspeaker to repeat his monstrous statements--the huissiers dressed in\\nblack with silver chains, walking up and down in front of the tribune,\\ncalling out at intervals: \"Silence, messieurs, s\\'il vous plait,\"--the\\nPresident ringing his bell violently to call the house to order, and\\nnobody paying the slightest attention,--the orator sometimes standing\\nquite still with folded arms waiting until the storm should abate,\\nsometimes dominating the hall and hurling abuse at his adversaries. W.\\nwas always perfectly quiet; his voice was low, not very strong, and he\\ncould not speak if there were an uproar. When he was interrupted in a\\nspeech he used to stand perfectly still with folded arms, waiting for a\\nfew minutes\\' silence. The deputies would call out: \"Allez! allez!\"\\ninterspersed with a few lively criticisms on what he was saying to them;\\nhe was perfectly unmoved, merely replied: \"I will go on with pleasure as\\nsoon as you will be quiet enough for me to be heard.\" Frenchmen\\ngenerally have such a wonderful facility of speech, and such a pitiless\\nlogic in discussing a question, that the debates were often very\\ninteresting. The public was interesting too. A great many women of all\\nclasses followed the sittings--several Egerias (not generally in their\\nfirst youth) of well-known political men sitting prominently in the\\nPresident\\'s box, or in the front row of the journalists\\' box, following\\nthe discussions with great interest and sending down little slips of\\npaper to their friends below--members\\' wives and friends who enjoyed\\nspending an hour or two listening to the speeches--newspaper\\ncorrespondents, literary ladies, diplomatists. It was very difficult to\\nget places, particularly when some well-known orators were announced to\\nspeak upon an important question. We didn\\'t always know beforehand, and\\nI remember some dull afternoons with one or two members making long\\nspeeches about purely local matters, which didn\\'t interest any one. We\\nlooked down upon an almost empty hall on those occasions. A great many\\nof the members had gone out and were talking in the lobbies; those who\\nremained were talking in groups, writing letters, walking about the\\nhall, quite unconscious apparently of the speaker at the tribune. I\\ncouldn\\'t understand how the man could go on talking to empty benches,\\nbut W. told me he was quite indifferent to the attention of his\\ncolleagues,--his speech was for his electors and would appear the next\\nday in the _Journal Officiel_. I remember one man talked for hours about\\n\"allumettes chimiques.\"\\n\\nLeon Say was a delightful speaker, so easy, always finding exactly the\\nword he wanted. It hardly seemed a speech when he was at the tribune,\\nmore like a causerie, though he told very plain truths sometimes to the\\npeuple souverain. He was essentially French, or rather Parisian, knew\\neverybody, and was au courant of all that went on politically and\\nsocially, and had a certain blague, that eminently French quality which\\nis very difficult to explain. He was a hard worker, and told me once\\nthat what rested him most after a long day was to go to a small\\nboulevard theatre or to read a rather lively yellowbacked novel.\\n\\nI never heard Gambetta speak, which I always regretted--in fact knew\\nvery little of him. He was not a ladies\\' man, though he had some devoted\\nwomen friends, and was always surrounded by a circle of political men\\nwhenever he appeared in public. (In all French parties, immediately\\nafter dinner, the men all congregate together to talk to each\\nother,--never to the women,--so unless you happen to find yourself\\nseated next to some well-known man, you never really have a chance of\\ntalking to him.) Gambetta didn\\'t go out much, and as by some curious\\nchance he was never next to me at dinner, I never had any opportunity of\\ntalking to him. He was not one of W.\\'s friends, nor an habitue of the\\nhouse. His appearance was against him--dark, heavy-looking, with an\\nenormous head.\\n\\nWhen I had had enough of the speeches and the bad atmosphere, I used to\\nwander about the terraces and gardens. How many beautiful sunsets I have\\nseen from the top of the terrace or else standing on the three famous\\npink marble steps (so well known to all lovers of poetry through Alfred\\nde Musset\\'s beautiful verses, \"Trois Marches Roses\"), seeing in\\nimagination all the brilliant crowd of courtiers and fair women that\\nused to people those wonderful gardens in the old days of Versailles! I\\nwent sometimes to the \"Reservoirs\" for a cup of tea, and very often\\nfound other women who had also driven out to get their husbands. We\\noccasionally brought back friends who preferred the quiet cool drive\\nthrough the Park of St. Cloud to the crowd and dust of the railway. The\\nCount de St. Vallier (who was not yet senator, but deeply interested in\\npolitics) was frequently at Versailles and came back with us often. He\\nwas a charming, easy talker. I never tired of hearing about the\\nbrilliant days of the last Empire, and the fetes at the Tuileries,\\nCompiegne, and St. Cloud. He had been a great deal at the court of\\nNapoleon III, had seen many interesting people of all kinds, and had a\\nwonderful memory. He must have had an inner sense or presentiment of\\nsome kind about the future, for I have heard him say often in speaking\\nof the old days and the glories of the Empire, when everything seemed so\\nprosperous and brilliant, that he used often to ask himself if it could\\nbe real--Were the foundations as solid as they seemed! He had been a\\ndiplomatist, was in Germany at the time of the Franco-German War, and\\nlike so many of his colleagues scattered over Germany, was quite aware\\nof the growing hostile feeling in Germany to France and also of\\nBismarck\\'s aims and ambitions. He (like so many others) wrote repeated\\nletters and warnings to the French Foreign Office, which apparently had\\nno effect. One heard afterward that several letters of that description\\nfrom French diplomatists in Germany were found unopened in a drawer at\\nthe ministry.\\n\\nIt was rather sad, as we drove through the stately alleys of the Park of\\nSt. Cloud, with the setting sun shining through the fine old trees, to\\nhear of all the fetes that used to take place there,--and one could\\nquite well fancy the beautiful Empress appearing at the end of one of\\nthe long avenues, followed by a brilliant suite of ladies and\\necuyers,--and the echoes of the cor de chasse in the distance. The\\nalleys are always there, and fairly well kept, but very few people or\\ncarriages pass. The park is deserted. I don\\'t think the cor de chasse\\nwould awaken an echo or a regret even, so entirely has the Empire and\\nits glories become a thing of the past. A rendezvous de chasse was a\\nvery pretty sight.\\n\\nWe went once to Compiegne before I was married, about three years before\\nthe war. We went out and breakfasted at Compiegne with a great friend of\\nours, M. de St. M., a chamberlain or equerry of the Emperor. We\\nbreakfasted in a funny old-fashioned little hotel (with a very good\\ncuisine) and drove in a big open break to the forest. There were a great\\nmany people riding, driving, and walking, officers of the garrison in\\nuniform, members of the hunt in green and gold, and a fair sprinkling of\\nred coats. The Empress looked charming, dressed always in the uniform of\\nthe hunt, green with gold braid, and a tricorne on her head,--all her\\nladies with the same dress, which was very becoming. One of the most\\nstriking-looking of her ladies was the Princess Anna Murat, the present\\nDuchesse de Mouchy, who looked very handsome in the tricorne and\\nbeautifully fitting habit. I didn\\'t see the Empress on her horse, as we\\nlost sight of them very soon. She and her ladies arrived on the field in\\nan open break. I saw the Emperor quite distinctly as he rode up and gave\\nsome orders. He was very well mounted (there were some beautiful horses)\\nbut stooped slightly, and had rather a sad face. I never saw him again,\\nand the Empress only long years after at Cowes, when everything had gone\\nout of her life.\\n\\nThe President, Marshal MacMahon, was living at the Prefecture at\\nVersailles and received every Thursday evening. We went there several\\ntimes--it was my first introduction to the official world. The first two\\nor three times we drove out, but it was long (quite an hour and a\\nquarter) over bad roads--a good deal of pavement. One didn\\'t care to\\ndrive through the Park of St. Cloud at night--it was very lonely and\\ndark. We should have been quite helpless if we had fallen upon any\\nenterprising tramps, who could easily have stopped the carriage and\\nhelped themselves to any money or jewels they could lay their hands on.\\nOne evening the Seine had overflowed and we were obliged to walk a long\\ndistance--all around Sevres--and got to Versailles very late and quite\\nexhausted with the jolting and general discomfort. After that we went\\nout by train--which put us at the Prefecture at ten o\\'clock. It wasn\\'t\\nvery convenient as there was a great rush for carriages when we arrived\\nat Versailles, still everybody did it. We generally wore black or dark\\ndresses with a lace veil tied over our heads, and of course only went\\nwhen it was fine. The evening was pleasant enough--one saw all the\\npolitical men, the marshal\\'s personal friends of the droite went to him\\nin the first days of his presidency,--(they rather fell off later)--the\\nGovernment and Republicans naturally and all the diplomatic corps. There\\nwere not many women, as it really was rather an effort to put one\\'s self\\ninto a low-necked dress and start off directly after dinner to the Gare\\nSt. Lazare, and have rather a rush for places. We were always late, and\\njust had time to scramble into the last carriage.\\n\\nI felt very strange--an outsider--all the first months, but my husband\\'s\\nfriends were very nice to me and after a certain time I was astonished\\nto find how much politics interested me. I learned a great deal from\\nmerely listening while the men talked at dinner. I suppose I should have\\nunderstood much more if I had read the papers regularly, but I didn\\'t\\nbegin to do that until W. had been minister for some time, and then\\nworked myself into a nervous fever at all the opposition papers said\\nabout him. However, all told, the attacks were never very vicious. He\\nhad never been in public life until after the war when he was named\\ndeputy and joined the Assemblee Nationale at Bordeaux--which was an\\nimmense advantage to him. He had never served any other government, and\\nwas therefore perfectly independent and was bound by no family\\ntraditions or old friendships--didn\\'t mind the opposition papers at\\nall--not even the caricatures. Some of them were very funny. There was\\none very like him, sitting quite straight and correct on the box of a\\nbrougham, \"John Cocher Anglais n\\'a jamais verse, ni accroche\" (English\\ncoachman who has never upset nor run into anything).\\n\\nThere were a few political salons. The Countess de R. received every\\nevening--but only men--no women were ever asked. The wives rather\\ndemurred at first, but the men went all the same--as one saw every one\\nthere and heard all the latest political gossip. Another hostess was the\\nPrincess Lize Troubetskoi. She was a great friend and admirer of\\nThiers--was supposed to give him a great deal of information from\\nforeign governments. She was very eclectic in her sympathies, and every\\none went to her, not only French, but all foreigners of any distinction\\nwho passed through Paris. She gave herself a great deal of trouble for\\nher friends, but also used them when she wanted anything. One of the\\nstories which was always told of the Foreign Office was her \"petit\\npaquet,\" which she wanted to send by the valise to Berlin, when the\\nComte de St. Vallier was French ambassador there. He agreed willingly to\\nreceive the package addressed to him, which proved to be a grand piano.\\n\\nThe privilege of sending packages abroad by the valise of the foreign\\naffairs was greatly abused when W. became Minister of Foreign Affairs.\\nHe made various changes, one of which was that the valise should be\\nabsolutely restricted to official papers and documents, which really was\\nperhaps well observed.\\n\\nThe Countess de Segur received every Saturday night. It was really an\\nOrleanist salon, as they were devoted friends of the Orleans family, but\\none saw all the moderate Republicans there and the centre gauche (which\\nstruggled so long to keep together and be a moderating influence, but\\nhas long been swallowed up in the ever-increasing flood of radicalism)\\nand a great many literary men, members of the Institute, Academicians,\\netc. They had a fine old house entre cour et jardin, with all sorts of\\ninteresting pictures and souvenirs. Countess de S. also received every\\nday before three o\\'clock. I often went and was delighted when I could\\nfind her alone. She was very clever, very original, had known all sorts\\nof people, and it was most interesting to hear her talk about King Louis\\nPhilippe\\'s court, the Spanish marriages, the death of the Duc d\\'Orleans,\\nthe Coup d\\'Etat of Louis Napoleon, etc. When she first began to receive,\\nduring the reign of Louis Philippe, the feeling was very bitter between\\nthe Legitimists (extreme Royalist party) and the Orleanists. The Duc\\nd\\'Orleans often came to them on Saturday evenings and always in a good\\ndeal of state, with handsome carriage, aides-de-camp, etc. She warned\\nher Legitimist friends when she knew he was coming (but she didn\\'t\\nalways know) and said she never had any trouble or disagreeable scenes.\\nEvery one was perfectly respectful to the duke, but the extreme\\nLegitimists went away at once.\\n\\nWe went quite often to Monsieur and Madame Thiers, who received every\\nevening in their big gloomy house in the Place St. Georges. It was a\\npolitical centre,--all the Republican party went there, and many of his\\nold friends, Orleanists, who admired his great intelligence, while\\ndisapproving his politics,--literary men, journalists, all the\\ndiplomatists and distinguished strangers. He had people at dinner every\\nnight and a small reception afterward,--Madame Thiers and her sister,\\nMademoiselle Dosne, doing the honours for him. I believe both ladies\\nwere very intelligent, but I can\\'t truthfully say they had any charm of\\nmanner. They never looked pleased to see any one, and each took\\ncomfortable little naps in their armchairs after dinner--the first\\ncomers had sometimes rather embarrassing entrances,--but I am told they\\nheld very much to their receptions. Thiers was wonderful; he was a very\\nold man when I knew him, but his eyes were very bright and keen, his\\nvoice strong, and he would talk all the evening without any appearance\\nof fatigue. He slept every afternoon for two hours, and was quite rested\\nand alert by dinner time. It was an interesting group of men that stood\\naround the little figure in the drawing-room after dinner. He himself\\nstood almost always leaning against the mantelpiece. Prince Orloff,\\nRussian ambassador, was one of the habitues of the salon, and I was\\nalways delighted when he would slip away from the group of men and join\\nthe ladies in Madame Thiers\\'s salon, which was less interesting. He knew\\neverybody, French and foreign, and gave me most amusing and useful\\nlittle sketches of all the celebrities. It was he who told me of old\\nPrince Gortschakoff\\'s famous phrase when he heard of Thiers\\'s death--(he\\ndied at St. Germain in 1877)--\"Encore une lumiere eteinte quand il y en\\na si peu qui voient clair,\"--(still another light extinguished, when\\nthere are so few who see clearly). Many have gone of that\\ngroup,--Casimir Perier, Leon Say, Jules Ferry, St. Vallier, Comte Paul\\nde Segur, Barthelemy St. Hilaire,--but others remain, younger men who\\nwere then beginning their political careers and were eager to drink in\\nlessons and warnings from the old statesman, who fought gallantly to\\nthe last.\\n\\nI found the first winter in Paris as the wife of a French deputy rather\\ntrying, so different from the easy, pleasant life in Rome. That has\\nchanged, too, of course, with United Italy and Rome the capital, but it\\nwas a small Rome in our days, most informal. I don\\'t ever remember\\nhaving written an invitation all the years we lived in Rome. Everybody\\nled the same life and we saw each other all day, hunting, riding,\\ndriving, in the villas in the afternoon, generally finishing at the\\nPincio, where there was music. All the carriages drew up and the young\\nmen came and talked to the women exactly as if they were at the opera or\\nin a ballroom. When we had music or danced at our house, we used to tell\\nsome well-known man to say \"on danse chez Madame King ce soir.\" That was\\nall. Paris society is much stiffer, attaches much more importance to\\nvisits and reception days.\\n\\nThere is very little informal receiving, no more evenings with no\\namusement of any kind provided, and a small table at one end of the room\\nwith orangeade and cakes, which I remember when I was first married (and\\nalways in Lent the quartet of the Conservatoire playing classical\\nsymphonies, which of course put a stop to all conversation, as people\\nlistened to the artists of the Conservatoire in a sort of sacred\\nsilence). Now one is invited each time, there is always music or a\\ncomedie, sometimes a conference in Lent, and a buffet in the\\ndining-room. There is much more luxury, and women wear more jewels.\\nThere were not many tiaras when I first knew Paris society; now every\\nyoung woman has one in her corbeille.\\n\\n[Illustration: The foyer of the Opera.]\\n\\nOne of the first big things I saw in Paris was the opening of the Grand\\nOpera. It was a pretty sight, the house crowded with women beautifully\\ndressed and wearing fine jewels which showed very little, the decoration\\nof the house being very elaborate. There was so much light and gilding\\nthat the diamonds were quite lost. The two great features of the evening\\nwere the young King of Spain (the father of the present King), a slight,\\ndark, youthful figure, and the Lord Mayor of London, who really made\\nmuch more effect than the King. He was dressed in his official robes,\\nhad two sheriffs and a macebearer, and when he stood at the top of the\\ngrand staircase he was an imposing figure and the public was delighted\\nwith him. He was surrounded by an admiring crowd when he walked in the\\nfoyer. Everybody was there and W. pointed out to me the celebrities of\\nall the coteries. We had a box at the opera and went very regularly. The\\nopera was never good, never has been since I have known it, but as it is\\nopen all the year round, one cannot expect to have the stars one hears\\nelsewhere. Still it is always a pleasant evening, one sees plenty of\\npeople to talk to and the music is a cheerful accompaniment to\\nconversation. It is astounding how they talk in the boxes and how the\\npublic submits. The ballet is always good. Halanzier was director of the\\nGrand Opera, and we went sometimes to his box behind the scenes, which\\nwas most amusing. He was most dictatorial, occupied himself with every\\ndetail,--was consequently an excellent director. I remember seeing him\\ninspect the corps de ballet one night, just before the curtain went up.\\nHe passed down the line like a general reviewing his troops, tapping\\nlightly with a cane various arms and legs which were not in position. He\\nwas perfectly smiling and good-humoured: \"Voyons, voyons, mes petites,\\nce n\\'est pas cela,\"--but saw everything.\\n\\nWhat W. liked best was the Theatre Francais. We hadn\\'t a box there, but\\nas so many of our friends had, we went very often. Tuesday was the\\nfashionable night and the Salle was almost as interesting as the stage,\\nparticularly if it happened to be a premiere, and all the critics and\\njournalists were there. Sarah Bernhardt and Croizette were both playing\\nthose first years. They were great rivals and it was interesting to see\\nthem in the same play, both such fine talents yet so totally different.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nM. WADDINGTON AS MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION\\n\\nIn March, 1876, W. was made, for the second time, \"Ministre de\\nl\\'Instruction Publique et des Beaux Arts,\" with M. Dufaure President du\\nConseil, Duc Decazes at the Foreign Office, and Leon Say at the\\nfinances. His nomination was a surprise to us. We didn\\'t expect it at\\nall. There had been so many discussions, so many names put forward. It\\nseemed impossible to come to an understanding and form a cabinet which\\nwould be equally acceptable to the marshal and to the Chambers. I came\\nin rather late one afternoon while the negotiations were going on, and\\nwas told by the servants that M. Leon Say was waiting in W.\\'s library to\\nsee him. W. came a few minutes afterward, and the two gentlemen remained\\na long time talking. They stopped in the drawing-room on their way to\\nthe door, and Say said to me: \"Eh bien, madame, je vous apporte une\\nportefeuille et des felicitations.\" \"Before I accept the felicitations,\\nI would like to know which portfolio.\" Of course when he said, \"Public\\ninstruction,\" I was pleased, as I knew it was the only one W. cared for.\\nMy brother-in-law, Richard Waddington, senator of the Seine\\nInferieure,[1] and one or two friends came to see us in the evening, and\\nthe gentlemen talked late into the night, discussing programmes,\\npossibilities, etc. All the next day the conferences went on, and when\\nthe new cabinet was presented to the marshal, he received them\\ngraciously if not warmly. W. said both Dufaure and Decazes were quite\\nwonderful, realising the state of affairs exactly, and knowing the\\ntemper of the house, which was getting more advanced every day and more\\ndifficult to manage.\\n\\n[Footnote 1: My brother-in-law, Richard Waddington, senator, died in\\nJune, 1913, some time after these notes were written.]\\n\\nW. at once convoked all the officials and staff of the ministry. He made\\nvery few changes, merely taking the young Count de Lasteyrie, now\\nMarquis de Lasteyrie, grandnephew of the Marquis de Lafayette, son of M.\\nJules de Lasteyrie, a senator and devoted friend of the Orleans family,\\nas his chef de cabinet. Two or three days after the new cabinet was\\nannounced, W. took me to the Elysee to pay my official visit to the\\nMarechale de MacMahon. She received us up-stairs in a pretty salon\\nlooking out on the garden. She was very civil, not a particularly\\ngracious manner--gave me the impression of a very energetic, practical\\nwoman--what most Frenchwomen are. I was very much struck with her\\nwriting-table, which looked most businesslike. It was covered with\\nquantities of letters, papers, cards, circulars of all kinds--she\\nattended to all household matters herself. I always heard (though she\\ndid not tell me) that she read every letter that was addressed to her,\\nand she must have had hundreds of begging letters. She was very\\ncharitable, much interested in all good works, and very kind to all\\nartists. Whenever a letter came asking for money, she had the case\\ninvestigated, and if the story was true, gave practical help at once. I\\nwas dismayed at first with the number of letters received from all over\\nFrance asking my intercession with the minister on every possible\\nsubject from a \"monument historique\" to be restored, to a pension given\\nto an old schoolmaster no longer able to work, with a large family to\\nsupport. It was perfectly impossible for me to answer them. Being a\\nforeigner and never having lived in France, I didn\\'t really know\\nanything about the various questions. W. was too busy to attend to such\\nsmall matters, so I consulted M. de L., chef de cabinet, and we agreed\\nthat I should send all the correspondence which was not strictly\\npersonal to him, and he would have it examined in the \"bureau.\" The\\nfirst few weeks of W.\\'s ministry were very trying to me--I went to see\\nso many people,--so many people came to see me,--all strangers with whom\\nI had nothing in common. Such dreary conversations, never getting beyond\\nthe most ordinary commonplace phrases,--such an absolutely different\\nworld from any I had ever lived in.\\n\\nIt is very difficult at first for any woman who marries a foreigner to\\nmake her life in her new country. There must be so many things that are\\ndifferent--better perhaps sometimes--but not what one has been\\naccustomed to,--and I think more difficult in France than in any other\\ncountry. French people are set in their ways, and there is so little\\nsympathy with anything that is not French. I was struck with that\\nabsence of sympathy at some of the first dinners I went to. The talk was\\nexclusively French, almost Parisian, very personal, with stories and\\nallusions to people and things I knew nothing about. No one dreamed of\\ntalking to me about my past life--or America, or any of my early\\nassociations--yet I was a stranger--one would have thought they might\\nhave taken a little more trouble to find some topics of general\\ninterest. Even now, after all these years, the difference of\\nnationality counts. Sometimes when I am discussing with very intimate\\nfriends some question and I find that I cannot understand their views\\nand they cannot understand mine, they always come back to the real\\ndifficulty: \"Ecoutez, chere amie, vous etes d\\'une autre race.\" I rather\\ncomplained to W. after the first three or four dinners--it seemed to me\\nbad manners, but he said no, I was the wife of a French political\\nman, and every one took for granted I was interested in the\\nconversation--certainly no one intended any rudeness. The first big\\ndinner I went to that year was at the Elysee--the regular official\\ndinner for the diplomatic corps and the Government. I had Baron von\\nZuylen, the Dutch minister, one of our great friends, on one side of me,\\nLeon Renault, prefet de police, on the other. Leon Renault was very\\ninteresting, very clever--an excellent prefet de police. Some of his\\nstories were most amusing. The dinner was very good (always were in the\\nmarshal\\'s time), not long, and mercifully the room was not too hot.\\nSometimes the heat was terrible. There were quite a number of people in\\nthe evening--the music of the garde republicaine playing, and a buffet\\nin the dining-room which was always crowded. We never stayed very late,\\nas W. always had papers to sign when we got home. Sometimes when there\\nwas a great press of work his \"signatures\" kept him two hours. I don\\'t\\nthink the marshal enjoyed the receptions very much. Like most soldiers\\nhe was an early riser, and the late hours and constant talking\\ntired him.\\n\\nI liked our dinners and receptions at the ministry. All the intelligence\\nof France passed through our rooms. People generally came early--by ten\\no\\'clock the rooms were quite full. Every one was announced, and it was\\nmost interesting to hear the names of all the celebrities in every\\nbranch of art and science. It was only a fleeting impression, as the\\nguests merely spoke to me at the door and passed on. In those days,\\nhardly any one shook hands unless they were fairly intimate--the men\\nnever. They made me low bows some distance off and rarely stopped to\\nexchange a few words with me. Some of the women, not many, shook hands.\\nIt was a fatiguing evening, as I stood so long, and a procession of\\nstrangers passed before me. The receptions finished early--every one had\\ngone by eleven o\\'clock except a few loiterers at the buffet. There are\\nalways a certain number of people at the big official receptions whose\\nprincipal object in coming seems to be to make a comfortable meal. The\\nservants always told me there was nothing left after a big party. There\\nwere no invitations--the reception was announced in the papers, so any\\none who felt he had the slightest claim upon the minister appeared at\\nthe party. Some of the dresses were funny, but there was nothing\\neccentric--no women in hats, carrying babies in their arms, such as one\\nused to see in the old days in America at the President\\'s reception at\\nthe White House, Washington--some very simple black silk dresses hardly\\nlow--and of course a great many pretty women very well dressed. Some of\\nmy American friends often came with true American curiosity, wanting to\\nsee a phase of French life which was quite novel to them.\\n\\nW. remained two years as Minister of Public Instruction, and my life\\nbecame at once very interesting, very full. We didn\\'t live at the\\nministry--it was not really necessary. All the work was over before\\ndinner, except the \"signatures,\" which W. could do just as well in his\\nlibrary at home. We went over and inspected the Hotel du Ministere in\\nthe rue de Grenelle before we made our final decision, but it was not\\nreally tempting. There were fine reception-rooms and a pretty garden,\\nbut the living-rooms were small, not numerous, and decidedly gloomy. Of\\ncourse I saw much less of W. He never came home to breakfast, except on\\nSunday, as it was too far from the rue de Grenelle to the Etoile. The\\nArc de Triomphe stands in the Place de l\\'Etoile at the top of the\\nChamps-Elysees. All the great avenues, Alma, Jena, Kleber, and the\\nadjacent streets are known as the Quartier de l\\'Etoile. It was before\\nthe days of telephones, so whenever an important communication was to be\\nmade to him when he was at home in the evening, a dragoon galloped up\\nwith his little black bag from which he extracted his papers. It made\\nquite an excitement in our quiet street the first time he arrived after\\nten o\\'clock. We just managed our morning ride, and then there were often\\npeople waiting to speak to W. before we started, and always when he came\\nback. There was a great amount of patronage attached to his ministry,\\nnominations to all the universities, lycees, schools, etc., and, what\\nwas most agreeable to me, boxes at all the government theatres,--the\\nGrand Opera, Opera Comique, Francais, Odeon, and Conservatoire. Every\\nMonday morning we received the list for the week, and, after making\\nour own selection, distributed them to the official world\\ngenerally,--sometimes to our own personal friends. The boxes of the\\nFrancais, Opera, and Conservatoire were much appreciated.\\n\\nI went very regularly to the Sunday afternoon concerts at the\\nConservatoire, where all classical music was splendidly given. They\\nconfined themselves generally to the strictly classic, but were\\nbeginning to play a little Schumann that year. Some of the faces of the\\nregular habitues became most familiar to me. There were three or four\\nold men with grey hair sitting in the first row of stalls (most\\nuncomfortable seats) who followed every note of the music, turning\\naround and frowning at any unfortunate person in a box who dropped a fan\\nor an opera-glass. It was funny to hear the hum of satisfaction when any\\nwell-known movement of Beethoven or Mozart was attacked. The orchestra\\nwas perfect, at its best I think in the \"scherzos\" which they took in\\nbeautiful style--so light and sure. I liked the instrumental part much\\nbetter than the singing. French voices, the women\\'s particularly, are\\nthin, as a rule. I think they sacrifice too much to the\\n\"diction,\"--don\\'t bring out the voices enough--but the style and\\ntraining are perfect of their kind.\\n\\nThe Conservatoire is quite as much a social feature as a school of\\nmusic. It was the thing to do on Sunday afternoon. No invitation was\\nmore appreciated, as it was almost impossible to have places unless one\\nwas invited by a friend. All the boxes and seats (the hall is small)\\nbelong to subscribers and have done so for one or two generations. Many\\nmarriages are made there. There are very few theatres in Paris to which\\ngirls can be taken, but the Opera Comique and the Conservatoire are very\\nfavourite resorts. When a marriage is pending the young lady, very well\\ndressed (always in the simplest tenue de jeune fille) is taken to the\\nConservatoire or the Opera Comique by her father and mother, and very\\noften her grandmother. She sits in front of the box and the young man in\\nthe stalls, where he can study his future wife without committing\\nhimself. The difference of dress between the jeune fille and the jeune\\nfemme is very strongly marked in France. The French girl never wears\\nlace or jewels or feathers or heavy material of any kind, quite unlike\\nher English or American contemporaries, who wear what they like. The\\nwedding-dress is classic, a simple, very long dress of white satin, and\\ngenerally a tulle veil over the face. When there is a handsome lace veil\\nin the family, the bride sometimes wears it, but no lace on her dress.\\nThe first thing the young married woman does is to wear a very long\\nvelvet dress with feathers in her hair.\\n\\nI think on the whole the arranged marriages turn out as well as any\\nothers. They are generally made by people of the same monde, accustomed\\nto the same way of living, and the fortunes as nearly alike as possible.\\nEverything is calculated. The young couple usually spend the summer with\\nparents or parents-in-law, in the chateau, and I know some cases where\\nthere are curious details about the number of lamps that can be lighted\\nin their rooms, and the use of the carriage on certain days. I am\\nspeaking of course of purely French marriages. To my American ideas it\\nseemed very strange when I first came to Europe, but a long residence in\\na foreign country certainly modifies one\\'s impressions. Years ago, when\\nwe were living in Rome, four sisters, before any of us were married, a\\ncharming Frenchwoman, Duchesse de B., who came often to the house, was\\nvery worried about this family of girls, all very happy at home and\\ncontented with their lives. It was quite true we danced and hunted and\\nmade a great deal of music, without ever troubling ourselves about the\\nfuture. The duchesse couldn\\'t understand it, used often to talk to\\nmother very seriously. She came one day with a proposal of marriage--a\\ncharming man, a Frenchman, not too young, with a good fortune, a title,\\nand a chateau, had seen Madam King\\'s daughters in the ballroom and\\nhunting-field, and would very much like to be presented and make his\\ncour. \"Which one?\" we naturally asked, but the answer was vague. It\\nsounded so curiously impersonal that we could hardly take it seriously.\\nHowever, we suggested that the young man should come and each one of the\\nfour would show off her particular talent. One would play and one would\\nsing (rather like the song in the children\\'s book, \"one could dance and\\none could sing, and one could play the violin\"), and the third, the\\npolyglot of the family, could speak several languages. We were rather\\npuzzled as to what my eldest sister could do, as she was not very\\nsociable and never spoke to strangers if she could help it, so we\\ndecided she must be very well dressed and preside at the tea-table\\nbehind an old-fashioned silver urn that we always used--looking like a\\nstately maitresse de maison receiving her guests. We confided all these\\nplans to the duchesse, but she was quite put out with us, wouldn\\'t bring\\nthe young man nor tell us his name. We never knew who he was. Since I\\nhave been a Frenchwoman (devant la loi)--I think all Americans remain\\nAmerican no matter where they marry,--I have interested myself three or\\nfour times in made marriages, which have generally turned out well.\\nThere were very few Americans married in France all those years, now\\nthere are legions of all kinds. I don\\'t remember any in the official\\nparliamentary world I lived in the first years of my marriage--nor\\nEnglish either. It was absolutely French, and rather borne French. Very\\nfew of the people, the women especially, had any knowledge or experience\\nof foreign countries, and didn\\'t care to have,--France was enough\\nfor them.\\n\\nW. was very happy at the Ministry of Public Instruction,--all the\\neducational questions interested him so much and the tournees en\\nprovince and visits to the big schools and universities,--some of them,\\nin the south of France particularly, singularly wanting in the most\\nelementary details of hygiene and cleanliness, and it was very difficult\\nto make the necessary changes, giving more light, air, and space.\\nRoutine is a powerful factor in this very conservative country, where so\\nmany things exist simply because they have always existed. Some of his\\nletters from Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Montpellier were most interesting.\\nAs a rule he was very well received and got on very well, strangely\\nenough, with the clergy, particularly the haut clerge, bishops and\\ncardinals. His being a Protestant was rather a help to him; he could\\ntake an impartial view of things.\\n\\nAt Bordeaux he stayed at the Prefecture, where he was very comfortable,\\nbut the days were fatiguing. He said he hadn\\'t worked so hard for years.\\nHe started at nine in the morning, visiting schools and universities,\\ncame home to breakfast at twelve, and immediately after had a small\\nreception, rectors, professors, and people connected with the schools he\\nwanted to talk to, at three started again seeing more schools and going\\nconscientiously over the buildings from basement to garret,--then visits\\nto the cardinal, archbishop, general commanding, etc.--a big dinner and\\nreception in the evening, the cardinal present in his red robes, his\\ncoadjutor in purple, the officers in uniform, and all the people\\nconnected in any way with the university, who were pleased to see their\\nchief. There was a total absence of Bonapartist senators and deputies\\n(which was not surprising, as W. had always been in violent opposition\\nto the Empire), who were rather numerous in these parts. W. was really\\nquite exhausted when he got back to Paris--said it was absolute luxury\\nto sit quietly and read in his library, and not talk. It wasn\\'t a luxury\\nthat he enjoyed very much, for whenever he was in the house there was\\nalways some one talking to him in his study and others waiting in the\\ndrawing-room. Every minute of the day he was occupied. People were\\nalways coming to ask for something for themselves or some members of\\ntheir family, always candidates for the Institute, anxiously inquiring\\nwhat their chances were, and if he had recommended them to his friends.\\nIt is striking even in this country of functionaries (I think there are\\nmore small public employees in France than in any other country) how\\nmany applicants there were always for the most insignificant places--a\\nFrenchman loves a cap with gold braid and gilt buttons on his coat.\\n\\nAll the winter of 1876, which saw the end of the National Assembly and\\nthe beginning of a new regime, was an eventful one in parliamentary\\ncircles. I don\\'t know if the country generally was very much excited\\nabout a new constitution and a change of government. I don\\'t think the\\ncountry in France (the small farmers and peasants) are ever much excited\\nabout the form of government. As long as the crops are good and there is\\nno war to take away their sons and able-bodied men, they don\\'t care,\\noften don\\'t know, whether a king or an emperor is reigning over them.\\nThey say there are some far-off villages half hidden in the forests and\\nmountains who still believe that a king and a Bourbon is reigning in\\nFrance. Something had to be decided; the provisoire could no longer\\ncontinue; the country could not go on without a settled government. All\\nthe arguments and negotiations of that period have been so often told,\\nthat I will not go into any details. The two centres, centre droit and\\ncentre gauche, had everything in their hands as the great moderating\\nelements of the Assembly, but the conflicting claims of the various\\nparties, Legitimist, Orleanist, Bonapartist, and advanced Left, made the\\nquestion a very difficult one.\\n\\nW. as a member of the Comite des Trente was very much occupied and\\npreoccupied. He came back generally very late from Versailles, and, when\\nhe did dine at home, either went out again after dinner to some of the\\nnumerous meetings at different houses or had people at home. I think the\\ngreat majority of deputies were honestly trying to do what they thought\\nbest for the country, and when one remembers the names and personalities\\non both sides--MacMahon, Broglie, d\\'Audiffret-Pasquier, Buffet, Dufaure,\\nand Thiers, Casimir Perier, Leon Say, Jules Simon, Jules Ferry,\\nFreycinet, and many others, it is impossible to think that any of those\\nmen were animated by any spirit other than love of the country and an\\nardent desire to see some stable government restored which would enable\\nFrance to take her place again among the great powers. Unfortunately the\\ndifference of opinion as to the form of government made things very\\ndifficult. Some of the young deputies, just fresh from the war and\\nsmarting under a sense of humiliation, were very violent in their abuse\\nof any Royalist and particularly Bonapartist restoration.\\n\\n[Illustration: Meeting of officers of the National Assembly, and of\\ndelegates of the new Chambers, in the salon of Hercules, palace of\\nVersailles. From _L\\'Illustration_, March 11. 1876.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nTHE SOCIAL SIDE OF A MINISTER\\'S WIFE\\n\\nMy first big dinner at the Ministry of Public Instruction rather\\nintimidated me. We were fifty people--I the only lady. I went over to\\nthe ministry in the afternoon to see the table, which was very well\\narranged with quantities of flowers, beautiful Sevres china, not much\\nsilver--there is very little left in France, it having all been melted\\nat the time of the Revolution. The official dinners are always well done\\nin Paris. I suppose the traditions of the Empire have been handed down.\\nWe arrived a few minutes before eight, all the staff and directors\\nalready there, and by ten minutes after eight every one had arrived. I\\nsat between Gerome, the painter, and Renan, two very different men but\\neach quite charming,--Gerome tall, slight, animated, talking very easily\\nabout everything. He told me who a great many of the people were, with a\\nlittle commentary on their profession and career which was very useful\\nto me, as I knew so few of them. Renan was short, stout, with a very\\nlarge head, almost unprepossessing-looking, but with a great charm of\\nmanner and the most delightful smile and voice imaginable. He often\\ndined with us in our own house, en petit comite, and was always\\ncharming. He was one of those happy mortals (there are not many) who\\nmade every subject they discuss interesting.\\n\\nAfter that first experience, I liked the big men\\'s dinners very much.\\nThere was no general conversation; I talked exclusively to my two\\nneighbours, but as they were always distinguished in some branch of art,\\nscience, or literature, the talk was brilliant, and I found the hour our\\ndinner lasted a very short one. W. was very particular about not having\\nlong dinners. Later, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where we\\nsometimes had eighty guests, the dinner was never over an hour. I did\\nnot remain the whole evening at the men\\'s dinners. As soon as they\\ndispersed to talk and smoke, I came away, leaving W. to entertain his\\nguests. We often had big receptions with music and comedie. At one of\\nour first big parties we had several of the Orleans family. I was rather\\nnervous, as I had never received royalty,--in fact I had never spoken to\\na royal prince or princess. I had lived a great deal in Rome, as a girl,\\nduring the last days of Pius IX, and I was never in Paris during the\\nEmpire. When we went back to Rome one winter, after the accession of\\nKing Victor Emmanuel, I found myself for the first time in a room with\\nroyalties, the Prince and Princesse de Piemont. I remember quite well\\nbeing so surprised by seeing two of the Roman men we knew very well come\\nbackward into the ballroom where we were sitting. I thought they must be\\nanticipating the Mardi Gras and were masquerading a little, didn\\'t\\nrealise that every one was standing. I remained sitting for a moment\\n(much to the horror of one of the English secretaries who was with us\\nand who thought we were going to make a spread-eagle American\\ndemonstration and remain sitting when royalty appeared). However, by\\nsome sort of instinct, we rose too (perhaps to see what was going on),\\njust as the princes passed. Princess Marguerite looked charming, dressed\\nin white, with her splendid pearls and beautiful fair hair.\\n\\nWhen it was decided that we should ask the Orleans princes to our party,\\nI thought I would go to see the Duc Decazes, the foreign minister, a\\ncharming man and charming colleague, to get some precise information\\nabout my part of the entertainment. He couldn\\'t think what I wanted when\\nI invaded his cabinet, and was much amused when I stated my case.\\n\\n\"There is nothing unusual in receiving the princes at a ministry. You\\nmust do as you have always done.\"\\n\\n\"But that is just the question, I have _never done_. I have never in my\\nlife exchanged a word with a royal personage.\"\\n\\n\"It is not possible!\"\\n\\n\"It is absolutely true; I have never lived anywhere where there was a\\ncourt.\"\\n\\nWhen he saw that I was in earnest he was as nice as possible, told me\\n_exactly_ what I wanted to know,--that I need not say \"Altesse royale\"\\nevery time I spoke, merely occasionally, as they all like it,--that I\\nmust speak in the third person, \"Madame veut-elle,\" \"Monseigneur veut-il\\nme permettre,\" etc., also that I must always be at the door when a\\nprincess arrived and conduct her myself to her seat.\\n\\n\"But if I am at one end of the long enfilade of rooms taking the\\nComtesse de Paris to her seat and another princess (Joinville or\\nChartres) should arrive; what has to be done?\"\\n\\n\"Your husband must always be at the door with his chef de cabinet, who\\nwill replace him while he takes the princess to her place.\"\\n\\nThe Marquise de L., a charming old lady with white hair, beautiful blue\\neyes, and pink cheeks, a great friend of the Orleans family, went with\\nme when I made my round of visits to thank the royal ladies for\\naccepting our invitation. We found no one but the Princesse Marguerite,\\ndaughter of the Duc de Nemours, who was living at Neuilly. I had all my\\ninstructions from the marquise, how many courtesies to make, how to\\naddress her, and above all not to speak until the princess spoke to me.\\nWe were shown into a pretty drawing-room, opening on a garden, where the\\nprincess was waiting, standing at one end of the room. Madame de L.\\nnamed me, I made my courtesies, the princess shook hands, and then we\\nremained standing, facing each other. She didn\\'t say anything. I stood\\nperfectly straight and quiet, waiting. She changed colour, moved her\\nhands nervously, was evidently overcome with shyness, but didn\\'t utter a\\nsound. It seemed very long, was really only a few seconds, but I was\\ngetting rather nervous when suddenly a child ran across the garden. That\\nbroke the ice and she asked me the classic royal question, \"Avez-vous\\ndes enfants, madame?\" I had only one, and he was rather small, but still\\nhis nurse, his teeth, and his food carried me on for a little while and\\nafter that we had some general conversation, but I can\\'t say the visit\\nwas really interesting. As long as I was in public life I regretted\\nthat I had but the one child,--children and nurseries and schoolrooms\\nwere always an unfailing topic of conversation. Frenchwomen of all\\nclasses take much more interest in the details of their nurseries and\\nthe education and bringing-up of their children than we Anglo-Saxons do.\\nI know several mammas who followed all the course of their sons\\' studies\\nwhen they were preparing their baccalaureat, even to writing the\\ncompositions. The head nurse (English) who takes entire charge of her\\nnursery, who doesn\\'t like any interference, and brings the children to\\ntheir mother at stated hours, doesn\\'t exist in France.\\n\\nOur party was very brilliant, all sorts of notabilities of all kinds,\\nand the leading Paris artists from the Grand Opera, Opera Comique, and\\nthe Francais. As soon as the performance was over W. told me I must go\\nand thank the artists; he could not leave his princes. I started off to\\nthe last of the long suite of salons where they were all assembled.\\nComte de L., W.\\'s chef de cabinet, went with me, and we were preceded by\\na huissier with sword and chain, who piloted us through the crowd. I\\nfelt very shy when I arrived in the greenroom. The artists were drawn up\\nin two rows, the women on one side, the men on the other, all eyes of\\ncourse fixed upon madame la ministresse. Madame Carvalho, Sarah\\nBernhardt, and Croizette were standing at the head of the long line of\\nwomen; Faure, Talazac, Delaunay, Coquelin, on the other side. I went\\nfirst all along the line of women, then came back by the men. I realised\\ninstantly after the first word of thanks and interest how easy it is for\\nprinces, or any one in high places, to give pleasure. They all responded\\nso smilingly and naturally to everything I said. After the first two or\\nthree words, I didn\\'t mind at all, and found myself discussing\\nacoustics, the difficulty of playing any well-known part without\\ncostumes, scenery, etc., the inconvenience of having the public so near,\\nquite easily. We often had music and recitations at our parties, and\\nthat was always a great pleasure to me. I remember so well one evening\\nwhen we had the chorus of the Conservatoire and they sang quite\\nbeautifully the old \"Plaisirs d\\'Amour\" of our childhood. It had a great\\nsuccess and they were obliged to repeat it. W. made one great innovation\\nin the dress of the ladies of the Conservatoire chorus. They were always\\ndressed in white, which was very well for the young, slight figures, but\\nwas less happy for a stout middle-aged lady. So after much discussion it\\nwas decided to adopt black as the official dress and I must say it was\\nan enormous improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SOCIAL SIDE\\n\\nAll sorts of interesting people came to see us at the Ministry of Public\\nInstruction,--among others the late Emperor of Brazil, Don Pedro de\\nBragance, who spent some months in Paris that year with his daughter,\\nthe young Comtesse d\\'Eu. He was a tall, good-looking man, with a\\ncharming easy manner, very cultivated and very keen about\\neverything--art, literature, politics. His gentlemen said he had the\\nenergy of a man of twenty-five, and he was well over middle age when he\\nwas in Paris. They were quite exhausted sometimes after a long day of\\nvisits and sightseeing with him. He was an early riser. One of the first\\nrendezvous he gave W. was at nine o\\'clock in the morning, which greatly\\ndisturbed that gentleman\\'s habits. He was never an early riser, worked\\nalways very late (said his best despatches were written after midnight),\\nand didn\\'t care about beginning his day too early. Another interesting\\npersonality was Mommsen, the German historian and savant. He was a\\npicturesque-looking old man with keen blue eyes and a quantity of white\\nhair. I don\\'t think anything modern interested him very much. He was an\\nold man when I first saw him, and looked even older than his age. He and\\nW. used to plunge into very long, learned discussions over antiquities\\nand medals. W. said the hours with Mommsen rested him, such a change\\nfrom the \"shop\" talk always mixed with politics in France.\\n\\nWe often had political breakfasts at home (more breakfasts than\\ndinners). Our Aisne deputies and senators were not very mondains, didn\\'t\\ncare much to dine out. They were pleasant enough when they talked about\\nsubjects that interested them. Henri Martin, senator of the Aisne, was\\nan old-fashioned Republican, absolutely convinced that no other\\ngovernment would ever succeed in France, but he was moderate. St.\\nVallier, also a senator from the Aisne, was nervous and easily\\ndiscouraged when things didn\\'t go smoothly, but he too thought the\\nRepublic was the only possible government now, whatever his preferences\\nmight have been formerly.\\n\\nW.\\'s ministry came to an end on the famous 16th of May, 1877, when\\nMarshal MacMahon suddenly took matters in his own hands and dismissed\\nhis cabinet presided over by M. Jules Simon. Things had not been going\\nsmoothly for some time, could not between two men of such absolute\\ndifference of origin, habits, and ideas. Still, the famous letter\\nwritten by the marshal to Jules Simon was a thunderclap. I was walking\\nabout the Champs-Elysees and Faubourg St. Honore on the morning of the\\n16th of May, and saw all the carriages, our own included, waiting at the\\nMinistry of the Interior, where the conseil was sitting. I went home to\\nbreakfast, thought W. was later than usual, but never dreamed of what\\nwas happening. When he finally appeared, quite composed and smiling,\\nwith his news, \"We are out of office; the marshal has sent us all about\\nour business,\" I could hardly believe it, even when he told me all the\\ndetails. I had known for a long time that things were not going well,\\nbut there were always so much friction and such opposing elements in the\\ncabinet that I had not attached much importance to the accounts of\\nstormy sittings and thought things would settle down.\\n\\n[Illustration: Theodor Mommsen. From a painting by Franz von Lenbach.]\\n\\nW. said the marshal was very civil to him, but it was evident that he\\ncould not stand Jules Simon any longer and the various measures that he\\nfelt were impending. We had many visitors after breakfast, all much\\nexcited, wondering what the next step would be--if the Chambers would be\\ndissolved, the marshal trying to impose a cabinet of the Right or\\nperhaps form another moderate liberal cabinet without Jules Simon, but\\nretaining some of his ministers. It was my reception afternoon, and\\nwhile I was sitting quietly in my drawing-room talking to some of my\\nfriends, making plans for the summer, quite pleased to have W. to\\nmyself again, the butler hurried into the room telling me that the\\nMarechale de MacMahon was on the stairs, coming to make me a visit. I\\nwas very much surprised, as she never came to see me. We met very\\nrarely, except on official occasions, and she made no secret of her\\ndislike to the official Republican ladies (but she was always absolutely\\ncorrect if not enthusiastic). I had just time to get to the head of the\\nstairs to receive her. She was very amiable, a little embarrassed, took\\na cup of tea--said the marshal was very sorry to part with W., he had\\nnever had any trouble or disagreement with him of any kind, but that it\\nwas impossible to go on with a cabinet when neither party had any\\nconfidence in the other. I quite agreed, said it was the fortunes of\\nwar; I hoped the marshal would find another premier who would be more\\nsympathetic with him, and then we talked of other things.\\n\\nMy friends were quite amused. One of them, Marquise de T., knew the\\nMarechale quite well, and said she was going to ask her if she was\\nobliged to make visites de condoleance to the wives of all the fallen\\nministers. W. was rather astonished when I told him who had come to tea\\nwith me, and thought the conversation must have been difficult. I told\\nhim, not at all, once the necessary phrases about the departing\\nministers were over. The piano was open, music littered about; she was\\nfond of music and she admired very much a portrait of father as a boy in\\nthe Harrow dress, asked who it was and what the dress was. She was a\\nperfect woman of the world, and no one was uncomfortable.\\n\\nIt seemed quite strange and very pleasant to take up my old life again\\nafter two years of public life. W. breakfasted at home, went to the\\nSenate every day and to the Institute on Fridays and we dined with our\\nfriends and had small dinners in our own house instead of official\\nbanquets at all the ministries (usually from Potel and Chabot at so much\\na head). Politics were very lively all summer. The Chambers were\\ndissolved almost at once after the constitution of the new cabinet,\\npresided over by the Duc de Broglie. It was evident from the first\\nmoment that the new ministry wouldn\\'t, couldn\\'t live. (The Duc de\\nBroglie was quite aware of the fact. His first words on taking office\\nwere: \"On nous a jetes a l\\'eau, maintenant il faut nager.\") He made a\\nvery good fight, but he had that worst of all faults for a leader, he\\nwas unpopular. He was a brilliant, cultured speaker, but had a curt,\\ndictatorial manner, with an air always of looking down upon his public.\\nSo different from his colleague, the Duc Decazes, whose charming,\\ncourteous manners and nice blue eyes made him friends even among his\\nadversaries. There is a well-known story told of the two dukes which\\nshows exactly the personality of the men. Some one, a deputy I think,\\nwanted something very much which either of the gentlemen could give. He\\nwent first to the Duc Decazes, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, who\\nreceived him charmingly, was most kind and courteous, but didn\\'t do what\\nthe man wanted. He then went to the Duc de Broglie, President du\\nConseil, who was busy, received him very curtly, cut short his\\nexplanations, and was in fact extremely disagreeable but did the thing,\\nand the man loved Decazes and hated de Broglie. All sorts of rumours\\nwere afloat; we used to hear the wildest stories and plans. One day W.\\ncame in looking rather preoccupied. There was an idea that the Right\\nwere going to take most stringent measures, arrest all the ministers,\\nmembers of Jules Simon\\'s cabinet, many of the prominent Liberals. He\\nsaid it was quite possible and then gave me various instructions. I was\\nabove all to make no fuss if they really came to arrest him. He showed\\nme where all his keys, papers, and money were, told me to go instantly\\nto his uncle, Mr. Lutteroth, who lived next door. He was an old\\ndiplomat, knew everybody, and would give me very good advice. I did not\\nfeel very happy, but like so many things that are foretold, nothing\\never happened.\\n\\nAnother rumour, from the extreme Left this time, was that a large armed\\nforce under the command of a well-known general, very high up in his\\ncareer, was to assemble in the north at Lille, a strong contingent of\\nRepublicans were to join them to be ready to act. I remember quite well\\ntwo of W.\\'s friends coming in one morning, full of enthusiasm for this\\nplan. I don\\'t think they quite knew what they were going to do with\\ntheir army. W. certainly did not. He listened to all the details of the\\nplan; they gave him the name of the general, supposed to have very\\nRepublican sympathies (not generally the case with officers), the number\\nof regiments, etc., who would march at a given signal, but when he said,\\n\"It is possible, you might get a certain number of men together, but\\nwhat would you do with them?\" they were rather nonplussed. They hadn\\'t\\ngot any further than a grand patriotic demonstration, with the military,\\ndrums beating, flags flying, and the Marseillaise being howled by an\\nexcited crowd. No such extreme measures, however, were ever carried\\nout. From the first moment it was evident that a large Republican\\nmajority would be returned; almost all the former deputies were\\nre-elected and a number of new ones, more advanced in their opinion. In\\nthe country it was the only topic of conversation.\\n\\nParliament was dissolved in June, 1877, but we remained in town until\\nthe end of July. It wasn\\'t very warm and many people remained until the\\nend of the session. The big schools too only break up on the 15th of\\nJuly, and many parents remain in Paris. The Republican campaign had\\nalready begun, and there were numerous little dinners and meetings when\\nplans and possibilities were discussed. W. got back usually very late\\nfrom Versailles. When he knew the sitting would be very late he sent me\\nword and I used to go and dine with mother, but sometimes he was kept on\\nthere from hour to hour. I had some long waits before we could dine, and\\nHubert, the coachman, used to spend hours in the courtyard of the Gare\\nSt. Lazare waiting for his master. We had a big bay mare, a very fast\\ntrotter, which always did the train service, and the two were stationed\\nthere sometimes from six-thirty to nine-thirty, but they never seemed\\nthe worse for it. W., though a very considerate man for his servants\\ngenerally, never worried at all about keeping his coachmen and horses\\nwaiting. He said the coachmen were the most warmly dressed men in Paris,\\nalways took care to be well covered, and we never had fancy,\\nhigh-stepping horses, but ordinary strong ones, which could wait\\npatiently. W. said the talk in the Chambers and in the lobbies was quite\\nwild--every sort of extravagant proposition was made. There were many\\nconferences with the Duc d\\'Audiffret-Pasquier, Duc de Broglie--with\\nCasimir Perier, Leon Say, Gambetta, Jules Ferry, and Freycinet--where\\nthe best men on both sides tried hard to come to an agreement. W. went\\nseveral times in August to see M. Thiers, who was settled at St.\\nGermain. The old statesman was as keen as ever, receiving every day all\\nsorts of deputations, advising, warning, encouraging, and quite\\nconfident as to the result of the elections. People were looking to him\\nas the next President, despite his great age. However, he was not\\ndestined to see the triumph of his ideas. He died suddenly at St.\\nGermain on the 3d of September. W. said his funeral was a remarkable\\nsight--thousands of people followed the cortege--all Paris showing a\\nlast respect to the liberateur du territoire (though there were still\\nclubs where he was spoken of as le sinistre vieillard). In August W.\\nwent to his Conseil-General at Laon, and I went down to my\\nbrother-in-law\\'s place at St. Leger near Rouen. We were a very happy\\ncosmopolitan family-party. My mother-in-law was born a Scotch-woman\\n(Chisholm). She was a fine type of the old-fashioned cultivated lady,\\nwith a charming polite manner, keenly interested in all that was going\\non in the world. She was an old lady when I married, and had outlived\\nalmost all her contemporaries, but she had a beautiful old age,\\nsurrounded by children and grandchildren. She had lived through many\\nvicissitudes from the time of her marriage, when she arrived at the\\nChateau of St. Remy in the Department of Eure-et-Loire (where my\\nhusband, her eldest son, was born), passing through triumphal arches\\nerected in honour of the young bride, to the last days when the fortunes\\nof the family were diminished by revolutions and political and business\\ncrises in France. They moved from St. Remy, selling the chateau, and\\nbuilt a house on the top of a green hill near Rouen, quite shut in by\\nbig trees, and with a lovely view from the Rond Point--the highest part\\nof the garden, over Rouen--with the spires of the cathedral in the\\ndistance. I used to find her every morning when I went to her room,\\nsitting at the window, her books and knitting on a table near--looking\\ndown on the lawn and the steep winding path that came up from the\\ngarden,--where she had seen three generations of her dear ones pass\\nevery day--first her husband, then her sons--now her grandsons. My\\nsister-in-law, R.\\'s wife, was also an Englishwoman; the daughter of the\\nhouse had married her cousin, de Bunsen, who had been a German\\ndiplomatist, and who had made nearly all his career in Italy, at the\\nmost interesting period of her history, when she was struggling for\\nemancipation from the Austrian rule and independence. I was an American,\\nquite a new element in the family circle. We had many and most animated\\ndiscussions over all sorts of subjects, in two or three languages, at\\nthe tea-table under the big tree on the lawn. French and English were\\nalways going, and often German, as de Bunsen always spoke to his\\ndaughter in German. My mother-in-law, who knew three or four languages,\\ndid not at all approve of the careless habit we had all got into of\\nmixing our languages and using French or Italian words when we were\\nspeaking English--if they came more easily. She made a rule that we\\nshould use only one language at meals--she didn\\'t care which one, but we\\nmust keep to it. My brother-in-law was standing for the deputation. We\\ndidn\\'t see much of him in the daytime--his electors and his visits and\\nspeeches and banquets de pompiers took up all his time. The beginning\\nof his career had been very different. He was educated in England--Rugby\\nand Woolwich--and served several years in the Royal Artillery in the\\nBritish army. His military training was very useful to him during the\\nFranco-Prussian War, when he equipped and commanded a field battery,\\nmaking all the campaign. His English brother officers always remembered\\nhim. Many times when we were living in England at the embassy, I was\\nasked about him. A curious thing happened in the House of Lords one day,\\nshowing the wonderful memory of princes for faces. R. was staying with\\nus for a few days, when the annual debate over the bill for marriage of\\na deceased wife\\'s sister came up. The Prince of Wales (late King Edward)\\nand all the other princes were present in the House. R. was there too,\\nstanding where all the strangers do, at the entrance of the lobby. When\\nthe debate was over, the Prince of Wales left. As he passed along, he\\nshook hands with several gentlemen also standing near the lobby,\\nincluding R. He stopped a moment in front of him, saying: \"I think this\\nis Mr. Waddington. The last time I saw you, you wore Her Majesty\\'s\\nuniform.\" He hadn\\'t seen him for twenty-five or thirty years. I asked\\nthe prince afterward how he recognised him. He said he didn\\'t know; it\\nwas perhaps noticing an unfamiliar face in the group of men standing\\nthere,--and something recalled his brother, the ambassador.\\n\\nIn September we went down to Bourneville and settled ourselves there for\\nthe autumn. W. was standing for the Senate with the Count de St. Vallier\\nand Henri Martin. They all preferred being named in their department,\\nwhere everybody knew them and their personal influence could make itself\\nmore easily felt. W.\\'s campaign was not very arduous. All the people\\nknew him and liked him--knew that he would do whatever he promised.\\nTheir programme was absolutely Republican, but moderate, and he only\\nmade a few speeches and went about the country a little. I often went\\nwith him when he rode, and some of our visits to the farmers and local\\nauthorities were amusing if not encouraging. We were always very well\\nreceived, but it wasn\\'t easy to find out what they really thought (if\\nthey did think about it at all) of the state of affairs. The small\\nlandowners particularly, the men who had one field and a garden, were\\nvery reserved. They listened attentively enough to all W. had to say. He\\nwas never long, never personal, and never abused his adversaries, but\\nthey rarely expressed an opinion. They almost always turned the\\nconversation upon some local matter or petty grievance. It didn\\'t seem\\nto me that they took the slightest interest in the extraordinary changes\\nthat were going on in France. A great many people came to see W. and\\nthere would be a curious collection sometimes in his library at the end\\nof the day. The doctor (who always had precise information--country\\ndoctors always have--they see a great many people and I fancy the women\\ntalk to them and tell them what their men are doing), one or two\\nfarmers, some schoolmasters, the mayors of the nearest villages, the\\ncaptains of the firemen and of the archers (they still shoot with bow\\nand arrow in our part of the country; every Sunday the men practise\\nshooting at a target)--the gendarmes, very useful these too to bring\\nnews--the notary, and occasionally a sous-prefet, but then he was a\\npersonage, representing the Government, and was treated with more\\nceremony than the other visitors. It was evident from all these sources\\nthat the Republicans were coming to the front en masse.\\n\\nThe Republicans (for once) were marvellously disciplined and kept\\ntogether. It was really wonderful when one thought of all the different\\nelements that were represented in the party. There was quite as much\\ndifference between the quiet moderate men of the Left Centre and the\\nextreme Left as there was between the Legitimists and any faction of the\\nRepublican party. There was a strong feeling among the Liberals that\\nthey were being coerced, that arbitrary measures, perhaps a coup d\\'etat,\\nwould be sprung upon them, and they were quite determined to resist. I\\ndon\\'t think there was ever any danger of a coup d\\'etat, at least as long\\nas Marshal MacMahon was the chief of state. He was a fine honourable,\\npatriotic soldier, utterly incapable of an illegality of any kind. He\\ndidn\\'t like the Republic, honestly thought it would never succeed with\\nthe Republicans (la Republique sans Republicains was for him its only\\nchance)--and he certainly had illusions and thought his friends and\\nadvisers would succeed in making and keeping a firm conservative\\ngovernment. How far that illusion was shared by his entourage it is\\ndifficult to say. They fought their battle well--government pressure\\nexercised in all ways. Prefets and sous-prefets changed, wonderful\\nprospects of little work and high pay held out to doubtful electors, and\\nthe same bright illusive promises made to the masses, which all parties\\nmake in all elections and which the people believe each time. The\\nRepublicans were not idle either, and many fiery patriotic speeches\\nwere made or their side. Gambetta always held his public with his\\npassionate, earnest declamation, and his famous phrase, that the marshal\\nmust \"se soumettre ou se demettre,\" became a password all through\\nthe country.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nA REPUBLICAN VICTORY AND A NEW MINISTRY\\n\\nThe elections took place in October-November, 1877, and gave at once a\\ngreat Republican majority. W. and his two colleagues, Count de St.\\nVallier and Henri Martin, had an easy victory, but a great many of their\\npersonal friends, moderates, were beaten. The centres were decidedly\\nweaker in the new Chambers. There was not much hope left of uniting the\\ntwo centres, Droite et Gauche, in the famous \"fusion\" which had been a\\ndream of the moderate men.\\n\\nThe new Chambers assembled at Versailles in November. The Broglie\\ncabinet was out, but a new ministry of the Right faced the new\\nParliament. Their life was very short and stormy; they were really dead\\nbefore they began to exist and in December the marshal sent for M.\\nDufaure and charged him to form a Ministere de Gauche. None of his\\npersonal friends, except General Borel at the War Office, was in the new\\ncombination. W. was named to the Foreign Office. I was rather\\ndisappointed when he came home and told me he had accepted that\\nportfolio. I thought his old ministry, Public Instruction, suited him so\\nwell, the work interested him, was entirely to his taste. He knew all\\nthe literary and educational world, not only in France but everywhere\\nelse--England, of course, where he had kept up with many of his\\nCambridge comrades, and Germany, where he also had literary connections.\\nHowever, that wide acquaintance and his perfect knowledge of English and\\nEnglish people helped him very much at once, not only at the Quai\\nd\\'Orsay, but in all the years he was in England as ambassador.\\n\\nThe new ministry, with Dufaure as President of the Council, Leon Say at\\nthe Finances, M. de Freycinet at Public Works, and W. at the Foreign\\nOffice was announced the 14th of December, 1877. The preliminaries had\\nbeen long and difficult--the marshal and his friends on one side--the\\nRepublicans and Gambetta on the other--the moderates trying to keep\\nthings together. Personally, I was rather sorry W. had agreed to be a\\nmember of the cabinet; I was not very keen about official life and\\nforesaw a great deal that would be disagreeable. Politics played such a\\npart in social life. All the \"society,\" the Faubourg St. Germain (which\\nrepresents the old names and titles of France), was violently opposed to\\nthe Republic. I was astonished the first years of my married life in\\nFrance, to see people of certain position and standing give the cold\\nshoulder to men they had known all their lives because they were\\nRepublicans, knowing them quite well to be honourable, independent\\ngentlemen, wanting nothing from the Republic--merely trying to do their\\nbest for the country. I only realised by degrees that people held off a\\nlittle from me sometimes, as the wife of a Republican deputy. I didn\\'t\\ncare particularly, as I had never lived in France, and knew very few\\npeople, but it didn\\'t make social relations very pleasant, and I should\\nhave been better pleased if W. had taken no active part. However, that\\nfeeling was only temporary. I soon became keenly interested in politics\\n(I suppose it is in the blood--all the men in my family in America were\\npoliticians) and in the discussion of the various questions which were\\nrapidly changing France into something quite different. Whether the\\nchange has been for the better it would be hard to say even now, after\\nmore than thirty-five years of the Republic.\\n\\nFreycinet was a great strength. He was absolutely Republican, but\\nmoderate--very clever and energetic, a great friend of Gambetta\\'s--and\\na beautiful speaker. I have heard men say who didn\\'t care about him\\nparticularly, and who were not at all of his way of thinking, that they\\nwould rather not discuss with him. He was sure to win them over to his\\ncause with his wonderful, clear persuasive arguments.\\n\\n[Illustration: Palace of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paris.]\\n\\nThe first days were very busy ones. W. had to see all his staff (a very\\nlarge one) of the Foreign Office, and organise his own cabinet. He was\\nout all day, until late in the evening, at the Quai d\\'Orsay; used to go\\nover there about ten or ten-thirty, breakfast there, and get back for a\\nvery late dinner, and always had a director or secretary working with\\nhim at our own house after dinner. I went over three or four times to\\ninspect the ministry, as I had a presentiment we should end by living\\nthere. The house is large and handsome, with a fine staircase and large\\nhigh rooms. The furniture of course was \"ministerial\"--stiff and\\nheavy--gold-backed chairs and sofas standing in rows against the walls.\\nThere were some good pictures, among others the \"Congres de Paris,\"\\nwhich occupies a prominent place in one of the salons, and splendid\\ntapestries. The most attractive thing was a fine large garden at the\\nback, but, as the living-rooms were up-stairs, we didn\\'t use it very\\nmuch. The lower rooms, which opened on the gardens, were only used as\\nreception-rooms. The minister\\'s cabinet was also down-stairs,\\ncommunicating by a small staircase with his bedroom, just overhead. The\\nfront of the house looks on the Seine; we had always a charming view\\nfrom the windows, at night particularly, when all the little steamers\\n(mouches) were passing with their lights. I had of course to make\\nacquaintance with all the diplomatic corps. I knew all the ambassadors\\nand most of the ministers, but there were some representatives of the\\nsmaller powers and South American Republics with whom I had never come\\nin contact. Again I paid a formal official visit to the Marechale de\\nMacMahon as soon as the ministry was announced. She was perfectly polite\\nand correct, but one felt at once she hadn\\'t the slightest sympathy for\\nanything Republican, and we never got to know each other any better all\\nthe months we were thrown together. We remained for several weeks at our\\nown house, and then most reluctantly determined to install ourselves at\\nthe ministry. W. worked always very late after dinner, and he felt it\\nwas not possible to ask his directors, all important men of a certain\\nage, to come up to the Quartier de l\\'Etoile at ten o\\'clock and keep them\\nbusy until midnight. W.\\'s new chef de cabinet, Comte de Pontecoulant,\\nwas very anxious that we should move, thought everything would be\\nsimplified if W. were living over there. I had never known Pontecoulant\\nuntil W. chose him as his chef de cabinet. He was a diplomatist with\\nsome years of service behind him, and was perfectly au courant of all\\nthe routine and habits of the Foreign Office. He paid me a short formal\\nvisit soon after he had accepted the post; we exchanged a few remarks\\nabout the situation, I hoped we would faire bon menage, and had no\\nparticular impression of him except that he was very French and stiff; I\\ndidn\\'t suppose I should see much of him. It seems curious now to look\\nback upon that first interview. We all became so fond of him, he was a\\nloyal, faithful friend, was always ready to help me in any small\\ndifficulties, and I went to him for everything--visits, servants,\\nhorses, etc. W. had no time for any details or amenities of life. We\\nmoved over just before New Year\\'s day. As the gros mobilier was already\\nthere, we only took over personal things, grand piano, screens, tables,\\neasy chairs, and small ornaments and bibelots. These were all sent off\\nin a van early one morning, and after luncheon I went over, having given\\nrendezvous to Pontecoulant and M. Kruft, chef du materiel, an\\nexcellent, intelligent man, who was most useful and devoted to me the\\ntwo years I lived at the ministry. I was very depressed when we drove\\ninto the courtyard. I had never lived on that side of the river, and\\nfelt cut off from all my belongings,--the bridge a terror, so cold in\\nwinter, so hot in summer,--I never got accustomed to it, never crossed\\nit on foot. The sight of the great empty rooms didn\\'t reassure me. The\\nreception-rooms of course were very handsome. There were a great many\\nservants, huissiers, and footmen standing about, and people waiting in\\nthe big drawing-room to speak to W. The living-rooms up-stairs were\\nghastly--looked bare and uncomfortable in the highest degree. They were\\nlarge and high and looked down upon the garden, though that on a bleak\\nDecember day was not very cheerful--but there were possibilities. Kruft\\nwas very sympathetic, understood quite well how I felt, and was ready to\\ndo anything in the way of stoves, baths, wardrobes in the lingerie, new\\ncarpets, and curtains, that I wanted. Pontecoulant too was eminently\\npractical, and I was quite amused to find myself discussing lingeries\\nand bathrooms with a total stranger whom I had only seen twice in my\\nlife. It took me about a week to get really settled. I went over every\\nday, returning to my own house to eat and sleep. Kruft did wonders; the\\nplace was quite transformed when I finally moved over. The rooms looked\\nvery bright and comfortable when we arrived in the afternoon of the 31st\\nof December (New Year\\'s eve). The little end salon, which I made my\\nboudoir, was hung with blue satin; my piano, screens, and little things\\nwere very well placed--plenty of palms and flowers, bright fires\\neverywhere--the bedrooms, nursery, and lingeries clean and bright. My\\nbedroom opened on a large salon, where I received usually, keeping my\\nboudoir for ourselves and our intimate friends. My special huissier,\\nGerard, who sat all day outside of the salon door, was presented to me,\\nand instantly became a most useful and important member of the\\nhousehold--never forgot a name or a face, remembered what cards and\\nnotes I had received, whether the notes were answered, or the bills\\npaid, knew almost all my wardrobe, would bring me down a coat or a wrap\\nif I wanted one suddenly down-stairs. I had frequent consultations with\\nPontecoulant and Kruft to regulate all the details of the various\\nservices before we were quite settled. We took over all our own servants\\nand found many others who were on the permanent staff of the ministry,\\nfootmen, huissiers, and odd men who attended to all the fires, opened\\nand shut all the doors, windows, and shutters. It was rather difficult\\nto organise the regular working service, there was such rivalry between\\nour own personal servants and the men who belonged to the house, but\\nafter a little while things went pretty smoothly. W. dined out the first\\nnight we slept at the Quai d\\'Orsay, and about an hour after we had\\narrived, while I was still walking about in my hat and coat, feeling\\nvery strange in the big, high rooms, I was told that the lampiste was\\nwaiting my orders (a few lamps had been lit in some of the rooms). I\\ndidn\\'t quite know what orders to give, hadn\\'t mastered yet the number\\nthat would be required; but I sent for him, said I should be alone for\\ndinner, perhaps one or two lamps in the dining-room and small salon\\nwould be enough. He evidently thought that was not at all sufficient,\\nwanted something more precise, so I said to light as he had been\\naccustomed to when the Duc Decazes and his family were dining alone\\n(which I don\\'t suppose they ever did, nor we either when we once took up\\nour life). Such a blaze of light met my eyes when I went to dinner that\\nI was quite bewildered--boudoir, billiard-room, dining-room (very large,\\nthe small round table for one person hardly perceptible), and corridors\\nall lighted \"a giorno.\" However, it looked very cheerful and kept me\\nfrom feeling too dreadfully homesick for my own house and familiar\\nsurroundings. The rooms were so high up that we didn\\'t hear the noise of\\nthe street, but the river looked alive and friendly with the lights on\\nthe bridges, and a few boats still running.\\n\\nWe had much more receiving and entertaining to do at the Quai d\\'Orsay\\nthan at any other ministry, and were obliged to go out much more\\nourselves. The season in the official world begins with a reception at\\nthe President\\'s on New Year\\'s day. The diplomatic corps and presidents\\nof the Senate and Chamber go in state to the Elysee to pay their\\nrespects to the chief of state--the ambassadors with all their staff in\\nuniform in gala carriages. It is a pretty sight, and there are always a\\ngood many people waiting in the Faubourg St. Honore to see the\\ncarriages. The English carriage is always the best; they understand all\\nthe details of harness and livery so much better than any one else. The\\nmarshal and his family were established at the Elysee. It wasn\\'t\\npossible for him to remain at Versailles--he couldn\\'t be so far from\\nParis, where all sorts of questions were coming up every day, and he was\\nobliged to receive deputations and reports, and see people of all kinds.\\nThey were already agitating the question of the Parliament coming back\\nto Paris. The deputies generally were complaining of the loss of time\\nand the discomfort of the daily journey even in the parliamentary train.\\nThe Right generally was very much opposed to having the Chambers back in\\nParis. I never could understand why. I suppose they were afraid that a\\nstormy sitting might lead to disturbances. In the streets of a big city\\nthere is always a floating population ready to espouse violently any\\ncause. At Versailles one was away from any such danger, and, except\\nimmediately around the palace, there was nobody in the long, deserted\\navenues. They often cited the United States, how no statesman after the\\nsigning of the Declaration of Independence (in Philadelphia) would have\\nventured to propose that the Parliament should sit in New York or\\nPhiladelphia, but the reason there was very different; they were obliged\\nto make a neutral zone, something between the North and the South. The\\nDistrict of Columbia is a thing apart, belonging to neither side. It has\\ncertainly worked very well in America. Washington is a fine city, with\\nits splendid old trees and broad avenues. It has a cachet of its own, is\\nunlike any other city I know in the world.\\n\\nThe marshal received at the Elysee every Thursday evening--he and his\\nstaff in uniform, also all the officers who came, which made a brilliant\\ngathering. Their big dinners and receptions were always extremely well\\ndone. Except a few of their personal friends, not many people of society\\nwere present--the diplomatic corps usually very well represented, the\\nGovernment and their wives, and a certain number of liberal deputies--a\\ngreat many officers. We received every fifteen days, beginning with a\\nbig dinner. It was an open reception, announced in the papers. The\\ndiplomats always mustered very strong, also the Parliament--not many\\nwomen. Many of the deputies remained in the country, taking rooms merely\\nwhile the Chambers were sitting, and their wives never appeared in\\nParis. \"Society\" didn\\'t come to us much either, except on certain\\noccasions when we had a royal prince or some very distinguished\\nforeigners. Besides the big official receptions, we often had small\\ndinners up-stairs during the week. Some of these I look back to with\\nmuch pleasure. I was generally the only lady with eight or ten men, and\\nthe talk was often brilliant. Some of our habitues were the late Lord\\nHoughton, a delightful talker; Lord Dufferin, then ambassador in St.\\nPetersburg; Sir Henry Layard, British ambassador in Spain, an\\ninteresting man who had been everywhere and seen and known everybody\\nworth knowing in the world; Count Schouvaloff, Russian ambassador in\\nLondon, a polished courtier, extremely intelligent; he and W. were\\ncolleagues afterward at the Congres de Berlin, and W. has often told me\\nhow brilliantly he defended his cause; General Ignatieff, Prince Orloff,\\nthe nunzio Monsignor Czascki, quite charming, the type of the prelat\\nmondain, very large (though very Catholic) in his ideas, but never\\naggressive or disagreeable about the Republic, as so many of the clergy\\nwere. He was very fond of music, and went with me sometimes to the\\nConservatoire on Sunday; he had a great admiration for the way they\\nplayed classical music; used to lean back in his chair in a corner\\n(would never sit in front of the box) and drink in every sound.\\n\\nWe sometimes had informal music in my little blue salon. Baron de\\nZuylen, Dutch minister, was an excellent musician, also Comte de Beust,\\nthe Austrian ambassador. He was a composer. I remember his playing me\\none day a wedding march he had composed for the marriage of one of the\\narchdukes. It was very descriptive, with bells, cannon, hurrahs, and a\\nnuptial hymn--rather difficult to render on a piano--but there was a\\ncertain amount of imagination in the composition. The two came often\\nwith me to the Conservatoire. Comte de Beust brought Liszt to me one\\nday. I wanted so much to see that complex character, made up of\\nenthusiasms of all kinds, patriotic, religious, musical. He was dressed\\nin the ordinary black priestly garb, looked like an ascetic with pale,\\nthin face, which lighted up very much when discussing any subject that\\ninterested him. He didn\\'t say a word about music, either then or on a\\nsubsequent occasion when I lunched with him at the house of a great\\nfriend and admirer, who was a beautiful musician. I hoped he would play\\nafter luncheon. He was a very old man, and played rarely in those days,\\nbut one would have liked to hear him. Madame M. thought he would perhaps\\nfor her, if the party were not too large, and the guests \"sympathetic\"\\nto him. I have heard so many artists say it made all the difference to\\nthem when they felt the public was with them--if there were one\\nunsympathetic or criticising face in the mass of people, it was the only\\nface they could distinguish, and it affected them very much. The piano\\nwas engagingly open and music littered about, but he apparently didn\\'t\\nsee it. He talked politics, and a good deal about pictures with some\\nartists who were present.\\n\\n[Illustration: Franz Liszt.]\\n\\nI did hear him play many years later in London. We were again lunching\\ntogether, at the house of a mutual friend, who was not at all musical.\\nThere wasn\\'t even a piano in the house, but she had one brought in for\\nthe occasion. When I arrived rather early, the day of the party, I found\\nthe mistress of the house, aided by Count Hatzfeldt, then German\\nambassador to England, busily engaged in transforming her drawing-room.\\nThe grand piano, which had been standing well out toward the middle of\\nthe room, open, with music on it (I dare say some of Liszt\\'s own--but I\\ndidn\\'t have time to examine), was being pushed back into a corner, all\\nthe music hidden away, and the instrument covered with photographs,\\nvases of flowers, statuettes, heavy books, all the things one doesn\\'t\\nhabitually put on pianos. I was quite puzzled, but Hatzfeldt, who was a\\ngreat friend of Liszt\\'s and knew all his peculiarities, when consulted\\nby Madame A. as to what she could do to induce Liszt to play, had\\nanswered: \"Begin by putting the piano in the furthest, darkest corner of\\nthe room, and put all sorts of heavy things on it. Then he won\\'t think\\nyou have asked him in the hope of hearing him play, and perhaps we can\\npersuade him.\" The arrangements were just finished as the rest of the\\ncompany arrived. We were not a large party, and the talk was pleasant\\nenough. Liszt looked much older, so colourless, his skin like ivory,\\nbut he seemed just as animated and interested in everything. After\\nluncheon, when they were smoking (all of us together, no one went into\\nthe smoking-room), he and Hatzfeldt began talking about the Empire and\\nthe beautiful fetes at Compiegne, where anybody of any distinction in\\nany branch of art or literature was invited. Hatzfeldt led the\\nconversation to some evenings when Strauss played his waltzes with an\\nentrain, a sentiment that no one else has ever attained, and to\\nOffenbach and his melodies--one evening particularly when he had\\nimprovised a song for the Empress--he couldn\\'t quite remember it. If\\nthere were a piano--he looked about. There was none apparently. \"Oh,\\nyes, in a corner, but so many things upon it, it was evidently never\\nmeant to be opened.\" He moved toward it, Liszt following, asking\\nComtesse A. if it could be opened. The things were quickly removed.\\nHatzfeldt sat down and played a few bars in rather a halting fashion.\\nAfter a moment Liszt said: \"No, no, it is not quite that.\" Hatzfeldt got\\nup. Liszt seated himself at the piano, played two or three bits of\\nsongs, or waltzes, then, always talking to Hatzfeldt, let his fingers\\nwander over the keys and by degrees broke into a nocturne and a wild\\nHungarian march. It was very curious; his fingers looked as if they\\nwere made of yellow ivory, so thin and long, and of course there wasn\\'t\\nany strength or execution in his playing--it was the touch of an old\\nman, but a master--quite unlike anything I have ever heard. When he got\\nup, he said: \"Oh, well, I didn\\'t think the old fingers had any music\\nleft in them.\" We tried to thank him, but he wouldn\\'t listen to us,\\nimmediately talked about something else. When he had gone we\\ncomplimented the ambassador on the way in which he had managed the\\nthing. Hatzfeldt was a charming colleague, very clever, very musical, a\\nthorough man of the world. I was always pleased when he was next to me\\nat dinner--I was sure of a pleasant hour. He had been many years in\\nParis during the brilliant days of the Empire, knew everybody there\\nworth knowing. He had the reputation, notwithstanding his long stay in\\nParis, of being very anti-French. I could hardly judge of that, as he\\nnever talked politics to me. It may very likely have been true, but not\\nmore marked with him than with the generality of Anglo-Saxons and\\nNorthern races, who rather look down upon the Latins, hardly giving them\\ncredit for their splendid dash and pluck--to say nothing of their\\nbrains. I have lived in a great many countries, and always think that as\\na people, I mean the uneducated mass, the French are the most\\nintelligent nation in the world. I have never been thrown with the\\nJapanese--am told they are extraordinarily intelligent.\\n\\nWe had a dinner one night for Mr. Gladstone, his wife, and a daughter.\\nMr. Gladstone made himself quite charming, spoke French fairly well, and\\nknew more about every subject discussed than any one else in the room.\\nHe was certainly a wonderful man, such extraordinary versatility and\\nsuch a memory. It was rather pretty to see Mrs. Gladstone when her\\nhusband was talking. She was quite absorbed by him, couldn\\'t talk to her\\nneighbours. They wanted very much to go to the Conciergerie to see the\\nprison where the unfortunate Marie Antoinette passed the last days of\\nher unhappy life, and Mr. Gladstone, inspired by the subject, made us a\\nsort of conference on the French Revolution and the causes which led up\\nto it, culminating in the Terror and the execution of the King and\\nQueen. He spoke in English (we were a little group standing at the\\ndoor--they were just going), in beautiful academic language, and it was\\nmost interesting, graphic, and exact. Even W., who knew him well and\\nadmired him immensely, was struck by his brilliant improvisation.\\n\\n[Illustration: William E. Gladstone. From a photograph by Samuel A.\\nWalker, London.]\\n\\nWe were often asked for permits by our English and American friends to\\nsee all the places of historical interest in Paris, and the two places\\nwhich all wanted to see were the Conciergerie and Napoleon\\'s tomb at the\\nInvalides. When we first came to Paris in 1866, just after the end of\\nthe long struggle between the North and South in America, our first\\nvisits too were for the Conciergerie, Invalides, and Notre Dame, where\\nmy father had not been since he had gone as a very young man with all\\nParis to see the flags that had been brought back from Austerlitz. They\\nwere interesting days, those first ones in Paris, so full of memories\\nfor father, who had been there a great deal in his young days, first as\\nan eleve in the Ecole Polytechnique, later when the Allies were in\\nParis. He took us one day to the Luxembourg Gardens, to see if he could\\nfind any trace of the spot where in 1815 during the Restoration Marshal\\nNey had been shot. He was in Paris at the time, and was in the garden a\\nfew hours after the execution--remembered quite well the wall against\\nwhich the marshal stood--and the comments of the crowd, not very\\nflattering for the Government in executing one of France\\'s bravest and\\nmost brilliant soldiers.\\n\\nAll the Americans who came to see us at the Quai d\\'Orsay were much\\ninterested in everything relating to General Marquis de Lafayette, who\\nleft an undying memory in America, and many pilgrimages were made to the\\nChateau de la Grange, where the Marquis de Lafayette spent the last\\nyears of his life and extended a large and gracious hospitality to all\\nhis friends. It is an interesting old place, with a moat all around it\\nand high solid stone walls, where one still sees the hole that was made\\nin the wall by a cannon-ball sent by Marechal de Turenne as he was\\npassing with his troops, as a friendly souvenir to the owner, with whom\\nhe was not on good terms. So many Americans and English too are imbued\\nwith the idea that there are no chateaux, no country life in France,\\nthat I am delighted when they can see that there are just as many as in\\nany other country. A very clever American writer, whose books have been\\nmuch read and admired, says that when travelling in France in the\\ncountry, he never saw any signs of wealth or gentlemen\\'s property. I\\nthink he didn\\'t want to admire anything French, but I wonder in what\\npart of France he has travelled. Besides the well-known historic\\nchateaux of Chaumont, Chenonceaux, Azay-le-Rideau, Maintenon, Dampierre,\\nJosselin, Valencay, and scores of others, there are quantities of small\\nLouis XV chateaux and manoirs, half hidden in a corner of a forest,\\nwhich the stranger never sees. They are quite charming, built of red\\nbrick with white copings, with stiff old-fashioned gardens, and trees\\ncut into all sorts of fantastic shapes. Sometimes the parish church\\ntouches the castle on one side, and there is a private entrance for the\\nseigneurs. The interior arrangements in some of the old ones leave much\\nto be desired in the way of comfort and modern improvements,--lighting\\nvery bad, neither gas nor electricity, and I should think no baths\\nanywhere, hardly a tub. On the banks of the Seine and the Loire, near\\nthe great forests, in all the departments near Paris there are\\nquantities of chateaux--some just on the border of the highroad,\\nseparated from it by high iron gates, through which one sees long\\nwinding alleys with stone benches and vases with red geraniums planted\\nin them, a sun-dial and stiff formal rows of trees--some less\\npretentious with merely an ordinary wooden gate, generally open, and\\nalways flowers of the simplest kind, geraniums, sunflowers, pinks,\\ndahlias, and chrysanthemums--what we call a jardin de cure, (curate\\'s\\ngarden)--but in great abundance. With very rare exceptions the lawns are\\nnot well kept--one never sees in this country the smooth green turf that\\none does in England.\\n\\nSome of the old chateaux are very stately--sometimes one enters by a\\nlarge quadrangle, quite surrounded by low arcades covered with ivy, a\\nfountain and good-sized basin in the middle of the courtyard, and a big\\nclock over the door--sometimes they stand in a moat, one goes over a\\ndrawbridge with massive doors, studded with iron nails and strong iron\\nbolts and chains which defend the entrance, making one think of old\\nfeudal days, when might was right, and if a man wanted his neighbours\\nproperty, he simply took it. Even some of the smaller chateaux have\\nmoats. I think they are more picturesque than comfortable--an\\nivy-covered house with a moat around it is a nest for mosquitoes and\\ninsects of all kinds, and I fancy the damp from the water must finish by\\npervading the house. French people of all classes love the country and a\\ngarden with bright flowers, and if the poorer ones can combine a rabbit\\nhutch with the flowers they are quite happy.\\n\\nI have heard W. speak sometimes of a fine old chateau in our\\ndepartment--(Aisne) belonging to a deputy, who invited his friends to\\nshoot and breakfast. The cuisine and shooting were excellent, but the\\naccommodations fantastic. The neighbours said nothing had been renewed\\nor cleaned since the chateau was occupied by the Cossacks under the\\nfirst Napoleon.\\n\\nWe got very little country life during those years at the Foreign\\nOffice. Twice a year, in April and August, W. went to Laon for his\\nConseil-General, over which he presided, but he was rarely able to stay\\nall through the session. He was always present on the opening day, and\\nat the prefet\\'s dinner, and took that opportunity to make a short\\nspeech, explaining the foreign policy of the Government. I don\\'t think\\nit interested his colleagues as much as all the local questions--roads,\\nschools, etc. It is astonishing how much time is wasted and how much\\nletter-writing is necessitated by the simplest change in a road or\\nrailway crossing in France. We had rather a short narrow turning to get\\ninto our gate at Bourneville, and W. wanted to have the road enlarged\\njust a little, so as to avoid the sharp angle. It didn\\'t interfere with\\nany one, as we were several yards from the highroad, but it was months,\\nmore than a year, before the thing was done. Any one of the workmen on\\nthe farm would have finished it in a day\\'s work.\\n\\nAt one of our small dinners I had such a characteristic answer from an\\nEnglish diplomatist, who had been ambassador at St. Petersburg. He was\\nreally a charming talker, but wouldn\\'t speak French. That was of no\\nconsequence as long as he only talked to me, but naturally all the\\npeople at the table wanted to talk to him, and when the general\\nconversation languished, at last, I said to him: \"I wish you would speak\\nFrench; none of these gentlemen speak any other language.\" (It was quite\\ntrue, the men of my husband\\'s age spoke very rarely any other language\\nbut their own; now almost all the younger generation speak German or\\nEnglish or both. Almost all my son\\'s friends speak English perfectly.)\\n\"Oh no, I can\\'t,\" he said; \"I haven\\'t enough the habit of speaking\\nFrench. I don\\'t say the things I want to say, only the things I can say,\\nwhich is very different.\" \"But what did you do in Russia?\" \"All the\\nwomen speak English.\" \"But for affairs, diplomatic negotiations?\" \"All\\nthe women speak English.\" I have often heard it said that the Russian\\nwomen were much more clever than the men. He evidently had found\\nit true.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\nTHE EXPOSITION YEAR\\n\\nThe big political dinners were always interesting. On one occasion we\\nhad a banquet on the 2d of December. My left-hand neighbour, a senator,\\nsaid to me casually: \"This room looks very different from what it did\\nthe last time I was in it.\" \"Does it? I should have thought a big\\nofficial dinner at the Foreign Office would have been precisely the same\\nunder any regime.\" \"A dinner perhaps, but on that occasion we were not\\nprecisely dining. I and a number of my friends had just been arrested,\\nand we were waiting here in this room strictly guarded, until it was\\ndecided what should be done with us.\" Then I remembered that it was the\\n2d of December, the anniversary of Louis Napoleon\\'s coup d\\'etat. He said\\nthey were quite unprepared for it, in spite of warnings. He was sent out\\nof the country for a little while, but I don\\'t think his exile was a\\nvery terrible one.\\n\\nI got my first lesson in diplomatic politeness from Lord Lyons, then\\nBritish ambassador in Paris. He was in Paris during the Franco-German\\nWar, knew everybody, and had a great position. He gave very handsome\\ndinners, liked his guests to be punctual, was very punctual himself,\\nalways arrived on the stroke of eight when he dined with us. We had an\\nAnnamite mission to dine one night and had invited almost all the\\nambassadors and ministers to meet them. There had been a stormy sitting\\nat the Chamber and W. was late. As soon as I was ready I went to his\\nlibrary and waited for him; I couldn\\'t go down and receive a foreign\\nmission without him. We were quite seven or eight minutes late and found\\nall the company assembled (except the Annamites, who were waiting with\\ntheir interpreter in another room to make their entry in proper style).\\nAs I shook hands with Lord Lyons (who was doyen of the diplomatic corps)\\nhe said to me: \"Ah, Madame Waddington, I see the Republic is becoming\\nvery royal; you don\\'t receive your guests any more, merely come into the\\nroom when all the company is assembled.\" He said it quite smilingly, but\\nI understood very well, and of course we ought to have been there when\\nthe first guests arrived. He was very amiable all the same and told me a\\ngreat many useful things--for instance, that I must never invite a\\ncardinal and an ambassador together, as neither of them would yield the\\nprecedence and I would find myself in a very awkward position.\\n\\n[Illustration: Lord Lyons.]\\n\\nThe Annamites were something awful to see. In their country all the men\\nof a certain standing blacken their teeth, and I suppose the dye makes\\ntheir teeth fall out, as they hadn\\'t any apparently, and when they\\nopened their mouths the black caverns one saw were terrifying. I had\\nbeen warned, but notwithstanding it made a most disagreeable impression\\non me. They were very richly attired, particularly the first three, who\\nwere tres grands seigneurs in Annam,--heavily embroidered silk robes,\\nfeathers, and jewels, and when they didn\\'t open their mouths they were\\nrather a decorative group,--were tall, powerfully built men. They knew\\nno French nor English--spoke through the interpreter. My intercourse\\nwith them was very limited. They were not near me at dinner, but\\nafterward I tried to talk to them a little. They all stood in a group at\\none end of the room, flanked by an interpreter--the three principal\\nchiefs well in front. I don\\'t know what the interpreter said to them\\nfrom me, probably embellished my very banal remarks with flowers of\\nrhetoric, but they were very smiling, opening wide their black mouths\\nand made me very low bows--evidently appreciated my intention and effort\\nto be amiable.\\n\\nThey brought us presents, carpets, carved and inlaid mother-of-pearl\\nboxes, cabinets, and some curious saddles, also gold-embroidered\\ncushions and slippers. Some Arab horses were announced with great pomp\\nfrom the Sultan\\'s stables. I was rather interested in them, thought it\\nwould be amusing to drive a long-tailed Arab pony in a little cart in\\nthe morning. They were brought one morning to the Quai d\\'Orsay, and W.\\ngave rendezvous to Comte de Pontecoulant and some of the sporting men of\\nthe cabinet, in the courtyard. There were also several stablemen, all\\nmuch interested in the idea of taming the fiery steeds of the desert.\\nThe first look was disappointing. They were thin, scraggy animals,\\napparently all legs and manes. Long tails they had, and small heads, but\\nanything so tame and sluggish in their movements could hardly be\\nimagined. One could scarcely get them to canter around the courtyard. We\\nwere all rather disgusted, as sometimes one sees pretty little Arab\\nhorses in Paris. I don\\'t know what became of them; I fancy they were\\nsent to the cavalry stables.\\n\\nOur first great function that winter was the service at the Madeleine\\nfor the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel, who died suddenly in the\\nbeginning of January, 1878. France sent a special mission to the\\nfuneral--the old Marshal Canrobert, who took with him the marshal\\'s son,\\nFabrice de MacMahon. The Church of the Madeleine was filled with people\\nof all kinds--the diplomatic corps in uniform, a very large\\nrepresentation of senators and deputies. There was a slight hesitation\\namong some of the Left--who were ardent sympathisers with young\\nItaly--but who didn\\'t care to compromise themselves by taking part in a\\nreligious ceremony. However, as a rule they went. Some of the ladies of\\nthe Right were rather put out at having to go in deep mourning to the\\nservice. I said to one of them: \"But you are not correct; you have a\\nblack dress certainly, but I don\\'t think pearl-grey gloves are proper\\nfor such an occasion.\" \"Oh, they express quite sufficiently the grief I\\nfeel on this occasion.\"\\n\\nIt was curious that the King should have gone before the old Pope, who\\nhad been failing for some time. Every day we expected to hear of his\\ndeath. There were many speculations over the new King of Italy, the\\nPrince Humbert of our day. As we had lived so many years in Rome, I was\\noften asked what he was like, but I really had no opinion. One saw him\\nvery little. I remember one day in the hunting-field he got a nasty\\nfall. His horse put his foot in a hole and fell with him. It looked a\\nbad accident, as if the horse were going to roll over on him. I, with\\none of my friends, was near, and seeing an accident (I didn\\'t know who\\nit was) naturally stopped to see if our groom could do anything, but an\\nofficer rode hurriedly up and begged us to go on, that the Prince would\\nbe very much annoyed if any one, particularly a woman, should notice his\\nfall. I saw him later in the day, looking all right on another horse,\\nand no one made any allusion to the accident.\\n\\nAbout a month after Victor Emmanuel\\'s death the old Pope died, the 8th\\nof February, 1878, quite suddenly at the end. He was buried of course in\\nRome, and it was very difficult to arrange for his funeral in the Rome\\nof the King of Italy. However, he did lie in state at St. Peter\\'s, the\\nnoble garde in their splendid uniforms standing close around the\\ncatafalque--long lines of Italian soldiers, the bersaglieri with their\\nwaving plumes, on each side of the great aisle. There was a magnificent\\nservice for him at Notre Dame. The Chambers raised their sitting as a\\nmark of respect to the head of the church, and again there was a great\\nattendance at the cathedral. There were many discussions in the monde\\n(society not official) \"as to whether one should wear mourning for the\\nSaint Pere.\" I believe the correct thing is not to wear mourning, but\\nalmost all the ladies of the Faubourg St. Germain went about in black\\ngarments for some time. One of my friends put it rather graphically: \"Si\\non a un ruban rose dans les cheveux on a tout de suite l\\'air d\\'etre la\\nmaitresse de Rochefort.\"\\n\\nAll Europe was engrossed with the question of the Pope\\'s successor.\\nIntrigues and undercurrents were going on hard in Rome, and the issue of\\nthe conclave was impatiently awaited. No one could predict any result.\\nThe election of Cardinal Pecci, future Leo XIII, seemed satisfactory, at\\nleast in the beginning.\\n\\nMy winter passed pleasantly enough; I began to feel more at home in my\\nnew quarters, and saw many interesting people of all kinds. Every now\\nand then there would be a very lively debate in the Parliament. W. would\\ncome home very late, saying things couldn\\'t go on like that, and we\\nwould surely be out of office in a few weeks. We always kept our house\\nin the rue Dumont d\\'Urville, and I went over every week, often thinking\\nthat in a few days we should be back there again.\\n\\nOne of my great trials was a reception day. W. thought I ought to have\\none, so every Friday I was at home from three until six, and very long\\nafternoons they were. I insisted upon having a tea-table, which was a\\nnovelty in those days, but it broke the stiff semicircle of red and gold\\narmchairs carefully arranged at one end of the room. Very few men took\\ntea. It was rather amusing to see some of the deputies who didn\\'t\\nexactly like to refuse a cup of tea offered to them by the minister\\'s\\nwife, holding the cup and saucer most carefully in their hands, making a\\npretence of sipping the tea and replacing it hastily on the table as\\nsoon as it was possible. I had of course a great many people of\\ndifferent nationalities, who generally didn\\'t know each other. The\\nambassadresses and ministers\\' wives sat on each side of my sofa--the\\nsmaller people lower down. They were all announced, my huissier, Gerard,\\ndoing it very well, opening the big doors and roaring out the names.\\nSometimes, at the end of the day, some of my own friends or some of the\\nyoung men from the chancery would come in, and that would cheer me up a\\nlittle. There was no conversation, merely an exchange of formal phrases,\\nbut I had some funny experiences.\\n\\nOne day I had several ladies whom I didn\\'t know at all, wives of\\ndeputies, or small functionaries at some of the ministries. One of my\\nfriends, Comtesse de B., was starting for Italy and Rome for the first\\ntime. She had come to ask me all sorts of questions about clothes,\\nhotels, people to see, etc. When she went away in a whirl of\\npreparations and addresses, I turned to one of my neighbours, saying:\\n\"Je crois qu\\'on est tres bien a l\\'Hotel de Londres a Rome,\" quite an\\ninsignificant and inoffensive remark--merely to say something. She\\nreplied haughtily: \"Je n\\'en sais rien, Madame; je n\\'ai jamais quitte\\nParis et je m\\'en vante.\" I was so astonished that I had nothing to say,\\nbut was afterward sorry that I had not continued the conversation and\\nasked her why she was so especially proud of never having left Paris.\\nTravelling is usually supposed to enlarge one\\'s ideas. Her answer might\\nhave been interesting. W. wouldn\\'t believe it when I told him, but I\\nsaid I couldn\\'t really have invented it. I used to go into his cabinet\\nat the end of the day always, when he was alone with Pontecoulant, and\\ntell them all my experiences which W. forbid me to mention anywhere\\nelse. I had a good many surprises, but soon learned never to be\\nastonished and to take everything as a matter of course.\\n\\nThe great interest of the summer was the Exposition Universelle which\\nwas to take place at the Trocadero, the new building which had been\\nbuilt on the Champ de Mars. The opening was announced for the 1st of May\\nand was to be performed with great pomp by the marshal. All Europe was\\nrepresented except Germany, and almost all the great powers were sending\\nprinces to represent their country. We went often to see how the works\\nwere getting on, and I must say it didn\\'t look as if it could possibly\\nbe ready for the 1st of May. There were armies of workmen in every\\ndirection and carts and camions loaded with cases making their way with\\ndifficulty through the mud. Occasionally a light case or bale would fall\\noff, and quantities of small boys who seemed always on the spot would\\nprecipitate themselves, tumbling over each other to pick up what fell,\\nand there would be protestations and explanations in every language\\nunder the sun. It was a motley, picturesque crowd--the costumes and\\nuniforms making so much colour in the midst of the very ordinary dark\\nclothes the civilised Western world affects. I felt sorry for the\\nOrientals and people from milder climes--they looked so miserably cold\\nand wretched shivering under the very fresh April breezes that swept\\nover the great plain of the Champ de Mars. The machines, particularly\\nthe American ones, attracted great attention. There was always a crowd\\nwaiting when some of the large pieces were swung down into their places\\nby enormous pulleys.\\n\\nThe opening ceremony was very brilliant. Happily it was a beautiful warm\\nday, as all the guests invited by the marshal and the Government were\\nseated on a platform outside the Trocadero building. All the diplomatic\\ncorps, foreign royalties, and commissioners of the different nations who\\nwere taking part in the exposition were invited. The view was lovely as\\nwe looked down from our seats. The great enclosure was packed with\\npeople. All the pavilions looked very gay with bright-coloured walls and\\nturrets, and there were flags, palms, flowers, and fountains\\neverywhere--the Seine running through the middle with fanciful bridges\\nand boats. There was a curious collection of people in the tribunes. The\\ninvitations had not been very easy to make. There were three Spanish\\nsovereigns, Queen Isabella, her husband, Don Francois d\\'Assizes, and the\\nDuc d\\'Aosta (King Amadee), who had reigned a few stormy months in Spain.\\nHe had come to represent Italy at the exposition. The marshal was rather\\npreoccupied with his Spanish royalties. He had a reception in the\\nevening, to which all were invited, and thought it would be wise to take\\ncertain precautions, so he sent one of his aides-de-camp to Queen\\nIsabella to say that he hoped to have the honour of seeing her in the\\nevening at the Elysee, but he thought it right to tell her that she\\nmight perhaps have some disagreeable meetings. She replied: \"Si c\\'est\\nmon mari de qui vous parlez, cela m\\'est tout a fait egal; si c\\'est le\\nDuc d\\'Aosta, je serai ravie de le voir.\"\\n\\nShe came to the reception, but her husband was already gone. The Due\\nd\\'Aosta was still there, and she walked straight up to him and kissed\\nhim on both cheeks, not an easy thing to do, for the duke was not at all\\nthe type of the gay lady\\'s man--very much the reverse. He looked a\\nsoldier (like all the princes of the house of Savoy) and at the same\\ntime a monk. One could easily imagine him a crusader in plumed helmet\\nand breastplate, supporting any privation or fatigue without a murmur.\\nHe was very shy (one saw it was an effort for him every time that any\\none was brought up to him and he had to make polite phrases), not in the\\nleast mondain, but simple, charming when one talked to him.\\n\\nI saw him often afterward, as he represented his brother, King Humbert,\\non various official occasions when I too was present--the coronation of\\nthe Emperor Alexander of Russia, the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. He was\\nalways a striking figure, didn\\'t look as if he belonged to our modern\\nworld at all. The marshal had a series of dinners and receptions which\\nwere most brilliant. There was almost always music or theatricals, with\\nthe best artists in Paris. The Comedie Francaise was much appreciated.\\nTheir style is so finished and sure. They played just as well at one end\\nof a drawing-room, with a rampe of flowers only separating them from the\\npublic, as in their own theatre with all the help of scenery, acoustics,\\nand distance. In a drawing-room naturally the audience is much nearer.\\n\\nI remember one charming party at the Elysee for the Austrian crown\\nprince, the unfortunate Archduke Rudolph. All the stars of the Theatre\\nFrancais were playing--Croizette, Reichemberg, Delaunay, Coquelin. The\\nprince seemed to enjoy himself. He was very good-looking, with a slight,\\nelegant figure and charming smile--didn\\'t look like a man whose life\\nwould end so tragically. When I saw him some years later in London, he\\nwas changed, looked older, had lost his gaiety, was evidently bored with\\nthe official entertaining, and used to escape from all the dinners and\\nreceptions as soon as he could.\\n\\nThe late King Edward (then Prince of Wales) won golden opinions always.\\nThere was certainly something in his personality which had an enormous\\nattraction for Parisians. He always seemed to enjoy life, never looked\\nbored, was unfailingly courteous and interested in the people he was\\ntalking to. It was a joy to the French people to see him at some of the\\nsmall theatres, amusing himself and understanding all the sous-entendus\\nand argot quite as well as they did. It would almost seem as if what\\nsome one said were true, that he reminded them of their beloved Henri\\nIV, who still lives in the heart of the nation.\\n\\nHis brother-in-law, the Prince of Denmark, was also most amiable. We met\\nhim often walking about the streets with one or two of his gentlemen,\\nand looking in at the windows like an ordinary provincial. He was tall,\\nwith a slight, youthful figure, and was always recognised. It was a\\ngreat satisfaction and pride to Parisians to have so many royalties and\\ndistinguished people among them again.\\n\\nThose two months of May and June gave back to Paris the animation and\\ngaiety of the last days of the Empire. There were many handsome\\ncarriages on the Champs-Elysees, filled with pretty, well-dressed women,\\nand the opera and all the theatres were packed. Paris was illuminated\\nthe night of the opening of the exposition, the whole city, not merely\\nthe Champs-Elysees and boulevards. As we drove across the bridge on our\\nway home from the reception at the Elysee, it was a beautiful sight--the\\nstreets full of people waiting to see the foreign royalties pass, and\\nthe view up and down the Seine, with the lights from the high buildings\\nreflected in the water--like fairy-land.\\n\\n[Illustration: His Royal Highness, Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1876.\\nFrom a photograph by Lock & Whitfield, London.]\\n\\nThe dinners and receptions at the Elysee and at all the ministries those\\nfirst weeks of the exposition were interesting but so fatiguing. Happily\\nthere were not many lunches nor day entertainments. I used to get a good\\ndrive every afternoon in the open carriage with mother and baby, and\\nthat kept me alive. Occasionally (not often) W. had a man\\'s dinner, and\\nthen I could go with some of my friends and dine at the exposition,\\nwhich was very amusing--such a curious collection of people. The rue des\\nNations was like a gigantic fair. We met all our friends, and heard\\nevery language under the sun. Among other distinguished foreign guests\\nthat year we had President and Mrs. Grant, who were received everywhere\\nin Europe (England giving the example) like royalties. When they dined\\nwith us at the Quai d\\'Orsay W. and I went to the top of the great\\nstaircase to meet them, exactly as we did for the Prince and Princess\\nof Wales.\\n\\nIt seems funny to me when I think of the very unceremonious manner in\\nwhich not only ex-presidents but actual presidents were treated in\\nAmerica when I was a child. I remember quite well seeing a president (I\\nhave forgotten which one now) come into the big drawing-room at the old\\nCozzen\\'s Hotel at West Point, with two or three gentlemen with him.\\nThere was a certain number of people in the room and nobody moved, or\\ndreamt of getting up. However, the Grants were very simple--accepted all\\nthe honours shown to them without a pose of any kind. The marshal gave\\nthem a big dinner at the Elysee. We arrived a little late (we always\\ndid) and found a large party assembled. The Grants came in just\\nafter us.\\n\\nThe Marechale said to me: \"The Chinese ambassador will take you to\\ndinner, Madame Waddington. He is an interesting, clever man, knows\\nEngland and the English well--speaks English remarkably well.\" Just\\nbefore dinner was announced the ambassador was brought up to me. He was\\na striking-looking man, tall, broad-shouldered, dignified, very\\ngorgeously attired in light-blue satin, embroidered in bright-coloured\\nflowers and gold and silver designs, and a splendid yellow bird of\\nparadise in his cap. He didn\\'t come quite up to me, made me a low bow\\nfrom a certain distance, and then fell back into a group of smaller\\nsatellites, all very splendidly dressed. When dinner was announced the\\nfirst couples filed off--the marshal with Mrs. Grant and the Marechale\\nwith President Grant and W. with his lady. There was a pause; I should\\nhave gone next, but my ambassador wasn\\'t forthcoming. I looked and\\nwondered. All the aides-de-camp were making frantic signals to me to go\\non, and the whole cortege was stopped. I really didn\\'t know what to\\ndo--I felt rather foolish. Presently the ambassador appeared--didn\\'t\\noffer me his arm, but again made me a low bow, which I returned and\\nmoved a few steps forward. He advanced too and we made a stately\\nprogress to the dining-room side by side. I heard afterward the\\nexplanation. It seemed that in those days (things have changed _now_ I\\nfancy) no Chinese of rank would touch any woman who didn\\'t belong to\\nhim, and the ambassador would have thought himself dishonoured (as well\\nas me) if he had offered me his arm. The dinner was anything but banal.\\n\\nWhen we finally got to the table I found myself on the marshal\\'s\\nleft--Mrs. Grant was on his right. The marshal neither spoke nor\\nunderstood English. Mrs. Grant spoke no French, so the conversation\\ndidn\\'t seem likely to be very animated. After a few moments Mrs. Grant\\nnaturally wished to say something to her host and she addressed him in\\nEnglish. \"Mr. President, I am so happy to be in your beautiful country,\"\\nthen the marshal to me: \"Madame Waddington je vous en prie, dites a\\nMadame Grant que je ne puis pas repondre; je ne comprends pas l\\'anglais;\\nje ne puis pas parler avec elle.\" \"Mrs. Grant, the marshal begs me to\\nsay to you that he regrets not being able to talk with you, but\\nunfortunately he does not understand English.\" Then there was a pause\\nand Mrs. Grant began again: \"What a beautiful palace, Mr. President. It\\nmust be delightful with that charming garden.\" Again the marshal to me:\\n\"Mais je vous en prie Madame, dites a Madame Grant que je ne puis pas\\ncauser avec elle. Il ne faut pas qu\\'elle me parle, je ne comprends pas.\"\\n\"Mrs. Grant, the marshal is distressed that he cannot talk to you, but\\nhe _really_ does not understand any English.\" It was very trying for\\nMrs. Grant. Happily her other neighbour knew a little English and she\\ncould talk to him, but all through dinner, at intervals, she began again\\nat the marshal.\\n\\nAfter a few moments I turned my attention to my ambassador. I had been\\nlooking at him furtively while I was interpreting for the marshal and\\nMrs. Grant. I saw that he _took_ everything that was offered to\\nhim--dishes, wines, sauces--but he never attacked anything without\\nwaiting to see what his neighbours did, when and how they used their\\nknives and forks,--then did exactly as they did,--never made a mistake.\\nI saw he was looking at the flowers on the table, which were very well\\narranged, so I said to him, speaking very slowly and distinctly, as one\\ndoes to a child or a deaf person: \"Have you pretty flowers in your\\ncountry?\" He replied promptly: \"Yes, yes, very hot, very cold, very hot,\\nvery cold.\" I was a little disconcerted, but thought I had perhaps\\nspoken indistinctly, and after a little while I made another attempt:\\n\"How much the uniforms add to the brilliancy of the fete, and the\\nChinese dress is particularly striking and handsome,\" but to that he\\nmade such a perfectly unintelligible answer that I refrained from any\\nfurther conversation and merely smiled at him from time to time, which\\nhe always acknowledged with a little bow.\\n\\nWe went back to the salons in the same way, side by side, and when the\\nmen had gone into one of the other rooms to talk and smoke, I went to\\nspeak to the Marechale, who said to me: \"I am sure you had a delightful\\ndinner, Madame Waddington. The Chinese ambassador is such a clever man,\\nhas travelled a great deal, and speaks such wonderful English.\"\\n\"Wonderful indeed, Madame la Marechale,\" and then I repeated our\\nconversation, which she could hardly believe, and which amused her very\\nmuch. She spoke English as well as I did.\\n\\nThe Grants were very much entertained during their stay in Paris, and we\\nmet them nearly every night. W. liked the general very much and found\\nhim quite talkative when he was alone with him. At the big dinners he\\nwas of course at a disadvantage, neither speaking nor understanding a\\nword of French. W. acted as interpreter and found that very fatiguing.\\nThere is so much repartee and sous-entendu in all French conversation\\nthat even foreigners who know the language well find it sometimes\\ndifficult to follow everything, and to translate quickly enough to keep\\none au courant is almost impossible. When they could they drifted into\\nEnglish, and W. said he was most interesting--speaking of the war and\\nall the North had done, without ever putting himself forward.\\n\\nWe had both of us often to act as interpreters with French and\\nAnglo-Saxons, neither understanding the other\\'s language, and always\\nfound it difficult. I remember a dinner at Sandringham some years ago\\nwhen W. was at the embassy. The Prince of Wales (late King Edward) asked\\nme to sit next to a foreign ambassador who understood not one word of\\nEnglish. The dinner was exclusively English--a great many clever\\nmen--the master of Trinity College, Cambridge (asked especially to meet\\nmy husband, who graduated from Trinity College), Lord Goschen, James\\nKnowles of the _Nineteenth Century_, Froude, the historian, Sir Henry\\nJames, Lord Wolseley, etc. The talk was very animated, very witty. There\\nwere peals of laughter all around the table. My ambassador was very\\nfidgety and nervous, appealing to me all the time, but by the time I had\\nlaboriously condensed and translated some of the remarks, they were\\ntalking of something quite different, and I am afraid he had very hazy\\nideas as to what they were all saying.\\n\\nWe saw, naturally, all the distinguished strangers who passed through\\nParis that year of 1878. Many of our colleagues in the diplomatic corps\\nhad played a great role in their own country. Prince Orloff, the Russian\\nambassador, was one of our great friends. He gave us very good advice on\\none or two occasions. He was a distinguished-looking man--always wore a\\nblack patch over one eye--he had been wounded in the Crimea. He spoke\\nEnglish as well as I did and was a charming talker. General Cialdini was\\nat the Italian embassy. He was more of a soldier than a statesman--had\\ncontributed very successfully to the formation of \"United Italy\" and the\\nsuppression of the Pope\\'s temporal power, and was naturally not exactly\\npersona grata to the Catholics in France. Prince and Princess Hohenlohe\\nhad succeeded Arnim at the German embassy. Their beginnings were\\ndifficult, as their predecessor had done nothing to make the Germans\\npopular in France, but their strong personality, tact, and understanding\\nof the very delicate position helped them enormously. They were\\nCatholics (the Princess born a Russian--her brother, Prince\\nWittgenstein, military attache at the Russian embassy) and very big\\npeople in their own country, so absolutely sure of themselves and their\\nposition that it was very difficult to slight them in any way. They\\nwould never have perceived it unless some extraordinary rudeness were\\nshown. The Princess was very striking-looking, tall, with a good figure,\\nand splendid jewels. When she was in full dress for a ball, or official\\nreception, she wore three necklaces, one on top of the other, and a big\\nhandsome, high tiara, which added to her height. She was the only lady\\nof the diplomatic corps whom Madame Grevy ever recognised in the first\\nweeks of her husband\\'s presidency. Madame Grevy was thrown suddenly not\\nvery young into such an absolutely new milieu, that she was quite\\nbewildered and couldn\\'t be expected to recognise half the women of the\\ndiplomatic corps, but the German ambassadress impressed her and she knew\\nher always. The princess was not very mondaine, didn\\'t care about\\nsociety and life in a city--preferred the country, with riding and\\nshooting and any sort of sport.\\n\\nWe had a very handsome dinner at the German embassy the winter of\\n1878--given to the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon. After dinner, with\\ncoffee, a bear made its appearance in the drawing-room, a \"baby bear\"\\nthey said, but I didn\\'t think it looked very small. The princess patted\\nit, and talked to it just as if it were a dog, and I must say the little\\nanimal was perfectly quiet, and kept close to her. I think the lights\\nand the quantity of people frightened it. It growled once or twice, and\\nwe all had a feeling of relief when it was taken away. I asked the\\nMarechale afterward if she were afraid. \"Oui, j\\'avais tres peur, mais je\\nne voulais pas le montrer devant ces allemands.\" (Yes, I was very\\nfrightened, but I would not show it before those Germans.) They had\\neventually to send the bear away, back to Germany. It grew wilder as it\\ngrew older, and became quite unmanageable--they couldn\\'t keep it in\\nthe embassy.\\n\\nHohenlohe was always pleasant and easy. I think he had a real sympathy\\nfor France and did his best on various delicate occasions. The year of\\nthe exposition (1878) we dined out every night and almost always with\\nthe same people. Hohenlohe often fell to me. He took me in to dinner ten\\ntimes in succession. The eleventh time we were each of us in despair as\\nwe filed out together, so I said to him: \"Don\\'t let us even pretend to\\ntalk; you can talk to your other neighbour and I will to mine.\" However,\\nwe _did_ talk chiffons, curiously enough. I had waited for a dress,\\nwhich only came home at the last moment, and when I put it on the\\ncorsage was so tight I could hardly bear it. It was too late to change,\\nand I had nothing else ready, so most uncomfortable I started for my\\ndinner. I didn\\'t dare to eat anything, hardly dared move, which\\nHohenlohe remarked, after seeing three or four dishes pass me untouched,\\nand said to me: \"I am afraid you are ill; you are eating nothing.\" \"No,\\nnot at all, only very uncomfortable\"--and then I explained the situation\\nto him--that my dress was so tight I could neither move nor eat. He was\\nmost indignant--\"How could women be so foolish--why did we want to\\nhave abnormally small waists and be slaves to our dressmakers?--men\\ndidn\\'t like made-up figures.\" \"Oh, yes, they do; all men admire a\\nslight, graceful figure.\" \"Yes, when it is natural, but no man\\nunderstands nor cares about a fashionably dressed woman--women dress for\\neach other\" (which is perfectly true).\\n\\n[Illustration: Prince Hohenlohe. After the painting by F.E. Laszlo.]\\n\\nHowever, he was destined to see other ladies very careful about their\\nfigures. The late Empress of Austria, who was a fine rider, spent some\\ntime one spring in Paris, and rode every morning in the Bois. She was\\nvery handsome, with a beautiful figure, had handsome horses and\\nattracted great attention. Prince Hohenlohe often rode with her. I was\\nriding with a friend one morning when we saw handsome horses waiting at\\nthe mounting-block, just inside the gates. We divined they were the\\nEmpress\\'s horses and waited to see her mount. She arrived in a coupe,\\nher maid with her, and mounted her horse from the block. The body of her\\nhabit was open. When she was settled in her saddle, the maid stepped up\\non the block and buttoned her habit, which I must say fitted\\nbeautifully--as if she were melted into it.\\n\\nThe official receptions were interesting that year, as one still saw a\\nfew costumes. The Chinese, Japanese, Persians, Greeks, and Roumanians\\nwore their national dress--and much better they look in them than in\\nthe ordinary dress coat and white tie of our men. The Greek dress was\\nvery striking, a full white skirt with high embroidered belt, but it was\\nonly becoming when the wearer was young, with a good figure. I remember\\na pretty Roumanian woman with a white veil spangled with gold, most\\neffective. Now every one wears the ordinary European dress except the\\nChinese, who still keep their costume. One could hardly imagine a\\nChinese in a frock coat and tall hat. What would he do with his pigtail?\\n\\nThe entertainments went on pretty well that year until August, almost\\nall the embassies and ministries receiving. Queen Isabella of Spain was\\nthen living in the big house in the Avenue Kleber, called the \"Palais\\nd\\'Espagne\" (now the Hotel Majestic). We used to meet her often driving\\nin the Bois. She was a big, stout, rather red-faced woman, didn\\'t make\\nmuch effect in a carriage in ordinary street dress, but in her palace,\\nwhen she received or gave an audience, she was a very royal lady. I\\nasked for an audience soon after W. was named to the Foreign Office. We\\nknew one of her chamberlains very well, Duc de M., and he arranged it\\nfor me. I arrived at the palace on the appointed day a little before\\nfour (the audience was for four). The big gates were open, a tall porter\\ndressed in red and gold lace and buttons, and a staff in his hand, was\\nwaiting--two or three men in black, and four or five footmen in red\\nliveries and powder, at the door and in the hall. I was shown at once to\\na small room on the ground floor, where four or five ladies, all Spanish\\nand all fat, were waiting. In a few minutes the duke appeared. We talked\\na little (he looking at me to see if I had taken off my veil and my\\nright-hand glove) and then a man in black appeared at the door, making a\\nlow bow and saying something in Spanish. The duke said would I come, Her\\nMajesty was ready to receive me. We passed through several salons where\\nthere were footmen and pages (no ladies) until we came to a very large\\none quite at the other end of the palace. The big doors were open, and\\nat the far end I saw the Queen standing, a stately figure (enormous),\\ndressed in a long black velvet dress, a high diamond tiara on her head,\\nfrom which hung a black lace veil, a fan in her hand (I suppose no\\nSpanish woman of any station ever parts with her fan) and a splendid\\nstring of pearls. I made my curtsey on the threshold, the chamberlain\\nnamed me with the usual formula: \"I have the honour to present to Your\\nMajesty, Madame Waddington, the wife of the Minister of Foreign\\nAffairs,\" then backed himself out of the room, and I proceeded down the\\nlong room to the Queen. She didn\\'t move, let me make my two curtseys,\\none in the middle of the room, one when I came close up to her--and then\\nshook hands. We remained standing a few minutes and then she sat down on\\na sofa (not a very small one) which she quite filled, and motioned me to\\ntake an armchair on one side. She was very amiable, had a charming\\nsmile, spoke French very well but with a strong Spanish accent. She said\\nshe was very glad to see my husband at the Foreign Office, and hoped he\\nwould stay long enough to do some real work--said she was very fond of\\nFrance, loved driving in the streets of Paris, there was always so much\\nto see and the people looked gay. She was very fond of the theatres,\\nparticularly the smaller ones, liked the real Parisian wit and gaiety\\nbetter than the measured phrase and trained diction of the Francais and\\nthe Odeon. She spoke most warmly of Marshal MacMahon, hoped that he\\nwould remain President of the Republic as long as the Republicans would\\nlet him, was afraid they would make his position impossible--but that\\nthe younger generation always wanted reforms and changes. I said I\\nthought that was the way of the world everywhere, in families as well\\nas nations--children could not be expected to see with the eyes of their\\nparents. Then we talked about the exposition--she said the Spanish show\\nwas very good--told me to look at the tapestries and embroideries, which\\nwere quite wonderful--gold and silver threads worked in with the\\ntapestries. The interview was pleasant and easy. When I took leave, she\\nlet me back down the whole length of the room, not half turning away as\\nso many princesses do after the first few steps, so as to curtail that\\nvery inconvenient exit. However, a day dress is never so long and\\ncumbersome as an evening dress with a train.\\n\\nThe chamberlain was waiting just outside the door, also two ladies in\\nwaiting, just as fat as the Queen. Certainly the mise en scene was very\\neffective. The number of servants in red liveries, the solitary standing\\nfigure at the end of the long enfilade of rooms, the high diamond comb\\nand long veil, quite transformed the very stout, red-faced lady whom I\\nused to meet often walking in the Bois.\\n\\nWe dined once or twice at the palace, always a very handsome dinner. One\\nfor the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon was beautifully done--all the\\nfootmen, dozens, in gala liveries, red and yellow, the maitre d\\'hotel in\\nvery dark blue with gold epaulettes and aiguillettes. The table was\\ncovered with red and yellow flowers and splendid gold plate, and a very\\ngood orchestra of guitars and mandolins played all through dinner, the\\nmusicians singing sometimes when they played a popular song. We were all\\nassembled in one of the large rooms waiting for the Queen to appear. As\\nsoon as the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon were announced, she came in,\\nmeeting them at the door, making a circle afterward, and shaking hands\\nwith all the ladies.\\n\\nLord Lyons gave a beautiful ball at the embassy that season. The hotel\\nof the British embassy is one of the best in Paris--fine reception-rooms\\nopening on a very large garden, and a large courtyard and side exit--so\\nthere was no confusion of carriages. He had need of all his room--Paris\\nwas crowded with English. Besides all the exposition people, there were\\nmany tourists and well-known English people, all expecting to be\\nentertained at the embassy. All the world was there. The Prince and\\nPrincess of Wales, the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon, the Orleans\\nprinces, Princesse Mathilde, the Faubourg St. Germain, the Government,\\nand as many foreigners as the house could hold, as he invited a great\\nmany people, once his obligations, English and official, were\\nsatisfied. It was only at an embassy that such a gathering could take\\nplace, and it was amusing to see the people of all the different camps\\nlooking at each other.\\n\\nThere was a supper up-stairs for all the royalties before the cotillion.\\nI was told that the Duc d\\'Aumale would take me to supper. I was very\\npleased (as we knew him very well and he was always charming to us) but\\nmuch surprised, as the Orleans princes never remained for supper at any\\nbig official function. There would have been questions of place and\\nprecedence which would have been very difficult to settle. When the move\\nwas made for supper, things had to be changed, as the Orleans princes\\nhad gone home. The Crown Prince of Denmark took me. The supper-room was\\nprettily arranged, two round tables--Lord Lyons with the Princesses of\\nWales and Denmark presiding at one--his niece, the Duchesse of Norfolk,\\nat the other, with the Princes of Wales and Denmark. I sat between the\\nPrinces of Denmark and Sweden. Opposite me, next the Prince of Wales,\\nsat a lady I didn\\'t know. Every one else at the table did. She was very\\nattractive-looking, with a charming smile and most animated manner. I\\nasked the Prince of Denmark in a low voice, who she was--thought it must\\nbe one of the foreign princesses I hadn\\'t yet met. The Prince of Wales\\nheard my question, and immediately, with his charming tact and ease of\\nmanner, said to me: \"You don\\'t know the Princesse Mathilde; do let me\\nhave the pleasure of presenting you to her,\" naming me at once--in my\\nofficial capacity, \"wife of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\" The\\nprincess was very gracious and smiling, and we talked about all sorts of\\nthings--some of her musical protegees, who were also mine. She asked me\\nif I liked living at the ministry, Quai d\\'Orsay; she remembered it as\\nsuch a beautiful house. When the party broke up, she shook hands, said\\nshe had not the pleasure of knowing M. Waddington, but would I thank him\\nfrom her for what he had done for one of her friends. I tried to find W.\\nafter supper to present him to the princess, but he had already gone,\\ndidn\\'t stay for the cotillion--the princess, too, went away immediately\\nafter supper. I met her once or twice afterward. She was always\\nfriendly, and we had little talks together. Her salon--she received once\\na week--was quite a centre--all the Bonapartists of course, the\\ndiplomatic corps, many strangers, and all the celebrities in\\nliterature and art.\\n\\nWith that exception I never saw nor talked with any member of that\\nfamily until I had been some years a widow, when the Empress Eugenie\\nreceived me on her yacht at Cowes. When the news came of the awful\\ntragedy of the Prince Imperial\\'s death in Zululand, W. was Foreign\\nMinister, and he had invited a large party, with music. W. instantly put\\noff the party, said there was no question of politics or a Bonapartist\\nprince--it was a Frenchman killed, fighting bravely in a foreign\\ncountry. I always thought the Empress knew about it and appreciated his\\nact, for during his embassy in London, though we never saw her, she\\nconstantly sent him word through mutual friends of little negotiations\\nshe knew about and thought might interest him, and always spoke very\\nwell of him as a \"clear-headed, patriotic statesman.\" I should have\\nliked to have seen her in her prime, when she must have been\\nextraordinarily beautiful and graceful. When I did see her she was no\\nlonger young, but a stately, impressive figure, and had still the\\nbeautiful brow one sees in all her pictures. One of our friends, a very\\nclever woman and great anti-Bonapartist, told us an amusing story of her\\nlittle son. The child was sometimes in the drawing-room when his mother\\nwas receiving, and heard her and all her friends inveighing against the\\niniquities of the Imperial Court and the frivolity of the Empress. He\\nsaw the Empress walking one day in the Bois de Boulogne. She was\\nattracted by the group of children, stopped and talked to them. The boy\\nwas delighted and said to his governess: \"Elle est bien jolie,\\nl\\'Imperatrice, mais il ne faut pas le dire a Maman.\" (The Empress is\\nvery pretty, but one must not say it to mother.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\nTHE BERLIN CONGRESS\\n\\nSeventy-eight was a most important year for us in many ways. Besides the\\ninterest and fatigues of the exposition and the constant receiving and\\nofficial festivities of all kinds, a great event was looming before\\nus--the Berlin Congress. One had felt it coming for some time. There\\nwere all sorts of new delimitations and questions to be settled since\\nthe war in the Balkans, and Europe was getting visibly nervous. Almost\\nimmediately after the opening of the exposition, the project took shape,\\nand it was decided that France should participate in the Congress and\\nsend three representatives. It was the first time that France had\\nasserted herself since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, but it was time\\nfor her now to emerge from her self-imposed effacement, and take her\\nplace in the Congress of nations. There were many discussions, both\\npublic and private, before the plenipotentiaires were named, and a great\\nunwillingness on the part of many very intelligent and patriotic\\nFrenchmen to see the country launching itself upon dangerous ground and\\na possible conflict with Bismarck. However, the thing was decided, and\\nthe three plenipotentiaries named--Mr. Waddington, Foreign Minister,\\nfirst; Comte de St. Vallier, a very clever and distinguished\\ndiplomatist, actual ambassador at Berlin, second; and Monsieur Desprey,\\nDirecteur de la Politique au Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres, third.\\nHe was also a very able man, one of the pillars of the ministry, au\\ncourant of every treaty and negotiation for the last twenty years, very\\nprudent and clear-headed. All W.\\'s colleagues were most cordial and\\ncharming on his appointment. He made a statement in the House of the\\nline of policy he intended to adopt--and was absolutely approved and\\nencouraged. Not a disparaging word of any kind was said, not even the\\nusual remark of \"cet anglais qui nous represente.\" He started the 10th\\nof June in the best conditions possible--not an instruction of any kind\\nfrom his chief, M. Dufaure, President du Conseil--very complimentary to\\nhim certainly, but the ministers taking no responsibility\\nthemselves--leaving the door open in case he made any mistakes. It was\\nevident that the Parliament and Government were nervous. It was rather\\namusing, when all the preparations for the departure were going on. W.\\ntook a large suite with him, secretaries, huissiers, etc., and I told\\nthem they were as much taken up with their coats and embroideries and\\ncocked hats as any pretty woman with her dresses. I wanted very much to\\ngo, but W. thought he would be freer and have more time to think things\\nover if I were not there. He didn\\'t know Berlin at all, had never seen\\nBismarck nor any of the leading German statesmen, and was fully\\nconscious how his every word and act would be criticised. However, if a\\npublic man is not criticised, it usually means that he is of no\\nconsequence--so attacks and criticisms are rather welcome--act as a\\nstimulant. I could have gone and stayed unofficially with a cousin, but\\nhe thought that wouldn\\'t do. St. Vallier was a bachelor; it would have\\nbeen rather an affair for him to organise at the embassy an apartment\\nfor a lady and her maids, though he was most civil and asked me to come.\\n\\n[Illustration: M. William Waddington. In the uniform he wore as Minister\\nof Foreign Affairs and at the Berlin Congress, 1878]\\n\\nI felt rather lonely in the big ministry when they had all gone, and I\\nwas left with baby. W. stayed away just five weeks, and I performed\\nvarious official things in his absence--among others the Review of the\\n14th of July. The distinguished guest on that occasion was the Shah of\\nPersia, who arrived with the Marechale in a handsome open carriage,\\nwith outriders and postilions. The marshal of course was riding. The\\nShah was not at all a striking figure, short, stout, with a dark skin,\\nand hard black eyes. He had handsome jewels, a large diamond fastening\\nthe white aigrette of his high black cap, and his sword-hilt incrusted\\nwith diamonds. He gave a stiff little nod in acknowledgment of the bows\\nand curtseys every one made when he appeared in the marshal\\'s box. He\\nimmediately took his seat on one side of the Marechale in front of the\\nbox, one of the ambassadresses, Princess Hohenlohe I think, next to him.\\nThe military display seemed to interest him. Every now and then he made\\nsome remark to the Marechale, but he was certainly not talkative. While\\nthe interminable line of the infantry regiments was passing, there was a\\nmove to the back of the box, where there was a table with ices,\\nchampagne, etc. Madame de MacMahon came up to me, saying: \"Madame\\nWaddington, Sa Majeste demande les nouvelles de M. Waddington,\" upon\\nwhich His Majesty planted himself directly in front of me, so close that\\nhe almost touched me, and asked in a quick, abrupt manner, as if he were\\nfiring off a shot: \"Ou est votre mari?\" (neither Madame, nor M.\\nWaddington, nor any of the terms that are usually adopted in polite\\nsociety). \"A Berlin, Sire.\" \"Pourquoi a Berlin?\" \"Comme\\nplenipotentiaire Francais au Congres de Berlin.\" \"Oui, oui, je sais, je\\nsais. Cela l\\'interesse?\" \"Beaucoup; il voit tant de personnes\\ninteressantes.\" \"Oui, je sais. Il va bien?\" always coming closer to me,\\nso that I was edging back against the wall, with his hard, bright little\\neyes fixed on mine, and always the same sharp, jerky tone. \"Il va\\nparfaitement bien, je vous remercie.\" Then there was a pause and he made\\none or two other remarks which I didn\\'t quite understand--I don\\'t think\\nhis French went very far--but I made out something about \"jolies femmes\"\\nand pointed out one or two to him, but he still remained staring into my\\nface and I was delighted when his minister came up to him (timidly--all\\nhis people were afraid of him) and said some personage wanted to be\\npresented to him. He shook hands with me, said something about \"votre\\nmari revient bientot,\" and moved off. The Marechale asked me if I were\\nnot touched by His Majesty\\'s solicitude for my husband\\'s health, and\\nwouldn\\'t I like to come to the front of the box and sit next to him, but\\nI told her I couldn\\'t think of engrossing His Majesty\\'s attention, as\\nthere were various important people who wished to be presented to him. I\\nwatched him a little (from a distance), trying to see if anything made\\nany impression on him (the crowd, the pretty, well-dressed women, the\\nmarch past, the long lines of infantry,--rather fatiguing to see, as one\\nline regiment looks very like another,--the chasseurs with their small\\nchestnut horses, the dragoons more heavily mounted, and the guns), but\\nhis face remained absolutely impassive, though I think he saw\\neverything. They told a funny story of him in London at one of the court\\nballs. When he had looked on at the dancing for some time, he said to\\nthe Prince of Wales: \"Tell those people to stop now, I have seen\\nenough\"--evidently thought it was a ballet performing for his amusement.\\nAnother one, at one of the European courts was funny. The monarch was\\nvery old, his consort also. When the Shah was presented to the royal\\nlady, he looked hard at her without saying a word, then remarked to her\\nhusband: \"Laide, vieille, pourquoi garder?\" (Ugly, old; why keep her?)\\n\\n[Illustration: Nasr-ed-Din, Shah of Persia.]\\n\\nI went to a big dinner and reception at the British Embassy, given for\\nall the directors and commissioners of the exposition. It was a lovely\\nwarm night, the garden was lighted, everybody walking about, and an\\norchestra playing. Many of the officials had their wives and daughters\\nwith them, and some of the toilettes were wonderful. There were a good\\nmany pretty women, Swedes and Danes, the Northern type, very fair hair\\nand blue eyes, attracting much attention, and a group of Chinese (all in\\ncostume) standing proudly aloof--not the least interested apparently in\\nthe gay scene before them. I wonder what they thought of European\\nmanners and customs! There was no dancing, which I suppose would have\\nshocked their Eastern morals. Lord Lyons asked me why I wasn\\'t in\\nBerlin. I said, \"For the best of reasons, my husband preferred going\\nwithout me--but I hoped he would send for me perhaps at the end of the\\nCongress.\" He told me Lady Salisbury was there with her husband. He\\nseemed rather sceptical as to the peaceful issue of the\\nnegotiations--thought so many unforeseen questions would come up and\\ncomplicate matters.\\n\\nI went to a ball at the Hotel de Ville, also given for all the\\nforeigners and French people connected with the exposition. The getting\\nthere was very long and tiring. The coupe-file did no good, as every one\\nhad one. Comte de Pontecoulant went with me and he protested vigorously,\\nbut one of the head men of the police, whom he knew well, came up to the\\ncarriage to explain that nothing could be done. There was a long line of\\ndiplomatic and official carriages, and we must take our chance with the\\nrest. Some of our cousins (Americans) never got there at all--sat for\\nhours in their carriage in the rue du Rivoli, moving an inch at a time.\\nHappily it was a lovely warm night; and as we got near we saw lots of\\npeople walking who had left their carriages some little distance off,\\nhopelessly wedged in a crowd of vehicles--the women in light dresses,\\nwith flowers and jewels in their hair. The rooms looked very handsome\\nwhen at last we did get in, particularly the staircase, with a Garde\\nMunicipal on every step, and banks of palms and flowers on the landing\\nin the hall, wherever flowers could be put. The Ville de Paris furnishes\\nall the flowers and plants for the official receptions, and they always\\nare very well arranged. Some trophies of flags too of all nations made a\\ngreat effect. I didn\\'t see many people I knew--it was impossible to get\\nthrough the crowd, but some one got me a chair at the open window giving\\non the balcony, and I was quite happy sitting there looking at the\\npeople pass. The whole world was represented, and it was interesting to\\nsee the different types--Southerners, small, slight, dark, impatient,\\nwriggling through the crowd--the Anglo-Saxons, big, broad, calm,\\nsquaring their shoulders when there came a sudden rush, and waiting\\nquite patiently a chance to get a little ahead. Some of the women too\\npushed well--evidently determined to see all they could. I don\\'t think\\nany royalties, even minor ones, were there.\\n\\nW. wrote pretty regularly from Berlin, particularly the first days,\\nbefore the real work of the Congress began. He started rather sooner\\nthan he had at first intended, so as to have a little time to talk\\nmatters over with St. Vallier and make acquaintance with some of his\\ncolleagues. St. Vallier, with all the staff of the embassy, met him at\\nthe station when he arrived in Berlin, also Holstein (our old friend who\\nwas at the German Embassy in Paris with Arnim) to compliment him from\\nPrince Bismarck, and he had hardly been fifteen minutes at the embassy\\nwhen Count Herbert von Bismarck arrived with greetings and compliments\\nfrom his father. He went to see Bismarck the next day, found him at\\nhome, and very civil; he was quite friendly, very courteous and\\n\"bonhomme, original, and even amusing in his conversation, but with a\\nhard look about the eyes which bodes no good to those who cross his\\npath.\" He had just time to get back to the embassy and get into his\\nuniform for his audience with the Crown Prince (late Emperor\\nFrederick).[1] The Vice Grand-Maitre des Ceremonies came for him in a\\ncourt carriage and they drove off to the palace--W. sitting alone on the\\nback seat, the grand-maitre facing him on the front. \"I was ushered into\\na room where the Prince was standing. He was very friendly and talked\\nfor twenty minutes about all sorts of things, in excellent French, with\\na few words of English now and then to show he knew of my English\\nconnection. He spoke of my travels in the East, of the de Bunsens, of\\nthe Emperor\\'s health (the old man is much better and decidedly\\nrecovering)--and of his great wish for peace.\" All the plenipotentiaries\\nhad not yet arrived. They appeared only on the afternoon of the 12th,\\nthe day before the Congress opened. Prince Bismarck sent out the\\ninvitation for the first sitting:\\n\\n[Footnote 1: The Crown Prince represented his father at all the\\nfunctions. Some days before the meeting of the Congress the old Emperor\\nhad been wounded in the arm by a nihilist, Nobiling, who Fired from a\\nwindow when the Emperor was passing in an open carriage. The wound was\\nslight, but the old man was much shaken and unable to take any part in\\nthe ceremonies or receive any of the plenipotentiaries.]\\n\\n                Le Prince de Bismarck\\n     a l\\'honneur de prevenir Son Excellence, Monsieur Waddington,\\n     que la premiere reunion du Congres aura lieu le\\n     13 juin a deux heures, au Palais du Chancelier de l\\'Empire,\\n     77, Wilhelmstrasse.\\n                      \"Berlin, le 12 juin 1878.\"\\n\\nIt was a brilliant assemblage of great names and intelligences that\\nresponded to his invitation--Gortschakoff, Schouvaloff, Andrassy,\\nBeaconsfield, Salisbury, Karolyi, Hohenlohe, Corti, and many others,\\nyounger men, who acted as secretaries. French was the language spoken,\\nthe only exception being made by Lord Beaconsfield, who always spoke in\\nEnglish, although it was most evident, W. said, that he understood\\nFrench perfectly well. The first day was merely an official opening of\\nthe Congress--every one in uniform--but only for that occasion. After\\nthat they all went in ordinary morning dress, putting on their uniforms\\nagain on the last day only, when they signed the treaty. W. writes:\\n\"Bismarck presides and did his part well to-day; he speaks French fairly\\nbut very slowly, finding his words with difficulty, but he knows what he\\nmeans to say and lets every one see that he does.\" No one else said much\\nthat first day; each man was rather reserved, waiting for his neighbour\\nto begin. Beaconsfield made a short speech, which was trying for some of\\nhis colleagues, particularly the Turks, who had evidently much\\ndifficulty in understanding English. They were counting upon England\\'s\\nsympathy, but a little nervous as to a supposed agreement between\\nEngland and Russia. The Russians listened most attentively. There seemed\\nto be a distrust of England on their part and a decided rivalry between\\nGortschakoff and Beaconsfield. The Congress dined that first night with\\nthe Crown Prince at the Schloss in the famous white hall--all in uniform\\nand orders. W. said the heat was awful, but the evening interesting.\\nThere were one hundred and forty guests, no ladies except the royal\\nprincesses, not even the ambassadresses. W. sat on Bismarck\\'s left, who\\ntalked a great deal, intending to make himself agreeable. He had a long\\ntalk after dinner with the Crown Princess (Princess Royal of England)\\nwho spoke English with him. He found her charming--intelligent and\\ncultivated and so easy--not at all stiff and shy like so many royalties.\\nHe saw her very often during his stay in Berlin, and she was unfailingly\\nkind to him--and to me also when I knew her later in Rome and London.\\nShe always lives in my memory as one of the most charming women I have\\never met. Her face often comes back to me with her beautiful bright\\nsmile and the saddest eyes I have ever seen. I have known very few like\\nher. W. also had a talk with Prince Frederick-Charles, father of the\\nDuchess of Connaught, whom he found rather a rough-looking soldier with\\na short, abrupt manner. He left bitter memories in France during the\\nFranco-German War, was called the \"Red Prince,\" he was so hard and\\ncruel, always ready to shoot somebody and burn down villages on the\\nslightest provocation--so different from the Prince Imperial, the \"unser\\nFritz\" of the Germans, who always had a kind word for the fallen foe.\\n\\n[Illustration: Prince Bismarck. From a sketch by Anton von Werner,\\n1880.]\\n\\nW.\\'s days were very full, and when the important sittings began it was\\nsometimes hard work. The Congress room was very hot (all the colleagues\\nseemed to have a holy horror of open windows)--and some of the men very\\nlong and tedious in stating their cases. Of course they were at a\\ndisadvantage not speaking their own language (very few of them knew\\nFrench well, except the Russians), and they had to go very carefully,\\nand be quite sure of the exact significance of the words they used. W.\\ngot a ride every morning, as the Congress only met in the afternoon.\\nThey rode usually in the Thiergarten, which is not very large, but the\\nbridle-paths were good. It was very difficult to get out of Berlin into\\nthe open country without going through a long stretch of suburbs and\\nsandy roads which were not very tempting. A great many officers rode in\\nthe park, and one morning when he was riding with the military attache\\nof the embassy, two officers rode up and claimed acquaintance, having\\nknown him in France in \\'70, the year of the war. They rode a short time\\ntogether, and the next day he received an invitation from the officers\\nof a smart Uhlan regiment to dine at their mess \"in remembrance of the\\nkind hospitality shown to some of their officers who had been quartered\\nat his place in France during the war.\" As the hospitality was decidedly\\nforced, and the presence of the German officers not very agreeable to\\nthe family, the invitation was not very happy. It was well meant, but\\nwas one of those curious instances of German want of tact which one\\nnotices so much if one lives much with Germans. The hours of the various\\nentertainments were funny. At a big dinner at Prince Bismarck\\'s the\\nguests were invited at six, and at eight-thirty every one had gone. W.\\nsat next to Countess Marie, the daughter of the house, found her simple\\nand inclined to talk, speaking both French and English well. Immediately\\nafter dinner the men all smoked everywhere, in the drawing-room, on the\\nterrace, some taking a turn in the park with Bismarck. W. found Princess\\nBismarck not very femme du monde; she was preoccupied first with her\\ndinner, then with her husband, for fear he should eat too much, or take\\ncold going out of the warm dining-room into the evening air. There were\\nno ladies at the dinner except the family. (The German lady doesn\\'t seem\\nto occupy the same place in society as the French and English woman\\ndoes. In Paris the wives of ambassadors and ministers are always invited\\nto all official banquets.)\\n\\nAmusements of all kinds were provided for the plenipotentiaries. Early\\nin July W. writes of a \"Land-parthie\"--the whole Congress (wives too\\nthis time) invited to Potsdam for the day. He was rather dreading a long\\nday--excursions were not much in his line. However, this one seems to\\nhave been successful. He writes: \"Our excursion went off better than\\ncould be expected. The party consisted of the plenipotentiaries and a\\ncertain number of court officers and generals. We started by rail,\\nstopped at a station called Wannsee, and embarked on board a small\\nsteamer, the Princess Royal receiving the guests as they arrived on\\nboard. We then started for a trip on the lakes, but before long there\\ncame a violent squall which obliged the sailors to take down the awnings\\nin double-quick time, and drove every one down into the cabins. It\\nlasted about half an hour, after which it cleared up and every one\\nreappeared on deck. In course of time we landed near Babelsberg, where\\ncarriages were waiting. I was told off to go in the first with the\\nPrincess Royal, Countess Karolyi (wife of the Austrian ambassador, a\\nbeautiful young woman), and Andrassy. We went over the Chateau of\\nBabelsberg, which is a pretty Gothic country-seat, not a palace, and\\nbelongs to the present Emperor. After that we had a longish drive,\\nthrough different parks and villages, and finally arrived at Sans Souci,\\nwhere we dined. After dinner we strolled through the rooms and were\\nshown the different souvenirs of Frederick the Great, and got home at\\nten-thirty.\" W. saw a good deal of his cousin, George de Bunsen, a\\ncharming man, very cultivated and cosmopolitan. He had a pretty house in\\nthe new quarter of Berlin, and was most hospitable. He had an\\ninteresting dinner there with some of the literary men and\\nsavants--Mommsen, Leppius, Helmholtz, Curtius, etc., most of them his\\ncolleagues, as he was a member of the Berlin Academy. He found those\\nevenings a delightful change after the long hot afternoons in the\\nWilhelmsstrasse, where necessarily there was so much that was long and\\ntedious. I think even he got tired of Greek frontiers, notwithstanding\\nhis sympathy for the country. He did what he could for the Greeks, who\\nwere very grateful to him and gave him, in memory of the efforts he made\\non their behalf, a fine group in bronze of a female figure--\"Greece\"\\nthrowing off the bonds of Turkey. Some of the speakers were very\\ninteresting. He found Schouvaloff always a brilliant debater--he spoke\\nFrench perfectly, was always good-humoured and courteous, and defended\\nhis cause well. One felt there was a latent animosity between the\\nEnglish and the Russians. Lord Beaconsfield made one or two strong\\nspeeches--very much to the point, and slightly arrogant, but as they\\nwere always made in English, they were not understood by all the\\nAssembly. W. was always pleased to meet Prince Hohenlohe, actual German\\nambassador to Paris (who had been named the third German\\nplenipotentiary). He was perfectly au courant of all that went on at\\ncourt and in the official world, knew everybody, and introduced W. to\\nvarious ladies who received informally, where he could spend an hour or\\ntwo quietly, without meeting all his colleagues. Blowitz, of course,\\nappeared on the scene--the most important person in Berlin (in his own\\nopinion). I am not quite convinced that he saw all the people he said he\\ndid, or whether all the extraordinary confidences were made to him which\\nhe related to the public, but he certainly impressed people very much,\\nand I suppose his letters as newspaper correspondent were quite\\nwonderful. He was remarkably intelligent and absolutely unscrupulous,\\ndidn\\'t hesitate to put into the mouths of people what he wished them to\\nsay, so he naturally had a great pull over the ordinary simple-minded\\njournalist who wrote simply what he saw and heard. As he was the Paris\\ncorrespondent of _The London Times_, he was often at the French Embassy.\\nW. never trusted him very much, and his flair was right, as he was\\nanything but true to him. The last days of the Congress were very busy\\nones. The negotiations were kept secret enough, but things always leak\\nout and the papers had to say something. I was rather emue at the tone\\nof the French press, but W. wrote me not to mind--they didn\\'t really\\nknow anything, and when the treaty was signed France would certainly\\ncome out very honourably. All this has long passed into the domain of\\nhistory, and has been told so many times by so many different people\\nthat I will not go into details except to say that the French\\nprotectorate of Tunis (now one of our most flourishing colonies) was\\nentirely arranged by W. in a long confidential conversation with Lord\\nSalisbury. The cession of the Island of Cyprus by Turkey to the English\\nwas a most unexpected and disagreeable surprise to W. However, he went\\ninstantly to Lord Salisbury, who was a little embarrassed, as that\\nnegotiation had been kept secret, which didn\\'t seem quite\\nfair--everything else having been openly discussed around the council\\ntable. He quite understood W.\\'s feelings in the matter, and was\\nperfectly willing to make an arrangement about Tunis. The thing was\\nneither understood nor approved at first by the French Government. W.\\nreturned to Paris, \"les mains vides; seulement a chercher dans sa poche\\non y eut trouve les cles de la Tunisie\"--as one of his friends defined\\nthe situation some years ago. He was almost disavowed by his Government.\\nThe ministers were timid and unwilling that France should take any\\ninitiative--even his friend, Leon Say, then Minister of Finances, a very\\nclever man and brilliant politician, said: \"Notre collegue Waddington,\\ncontre son habitude, s\\'est emballe cette fois pour la question de la\\nTunisie.\" (Our colleague Waddington, contrary to his nature, has quite\\nlost his head this time over the Tunis question.) I think the course of\\nevents has fully justified his action, and now that it has proved such a\\nsuccess, every one claims to have taken the initiative of the French\\nprotectorate of Tunis. All honours have been paid to those who carried\\nout the project, and very little is said of the man who originated the\\nscheme in spite of great difficulties at home and abroad. Some of W.\\'s\\nfriends know the truth.\\n\\n[Illustration: The Berlin Congress. From a painting by Anton von Werner,\\n1881.]\\n\\nThere was a great exchange of visits, photographs, and autographs the\\nlast days of the Congress. Among other things which W. brought back from\\nBerlin, and which will be treasured by his grandsons as a historical\\nsouvenir, was a fan, quite a plain wooden fan, with the signatures of\\nall the plenipotentiaries--some of them very characteristic. The French\\nsignatures are curiously small and distinct, a contrast to Bismarck\\'s\\nsmudge. W. was quite sorry to say good-bye to some of his colleagues.\\nAndrassy, with his quick sympathies and instant comprehension of all\\nsides of a question, attracted him very much. He was a striking\\npersonality, quite the Slav type. W. had little private intercourse with\\nPrince Gortschakoff--who was already an old man and the type of the\\nold-fashioned diplomatist--making very long and well-turned phrases\\nwhich made people rather impatient. On the whole W. was satisfied. He\\nwrites two or three days before the signing of the treaty: \"As far as I\\ncan see at present, no one will be satisfied with the result of the\\nCongress; it is perhaps the best proof that it is dealing fairly and\\nequitably with the very exaggerated claims and pretensions of all\\nparties. Anyhow, France will come out of the whole affair honourably and\\nhaving done all that a strictly neutral power can do.\" The treaty was\\nsigned on July 13 by all the plenipotentiaries in full uniform. W.\\nsaid there was a decided feeling of satisfaction and relief that it was\\nfinished. Even Bismarck looked less preoccupied, as if a weight had been\\nlifted from his shoulders. Of course he was supposed to have had his own\\nway in everything. Everybody (not only the French) was afraid of him.\\nWith his iron will, and unscrupulous brushing aside, or even\\nannihilating, everything that came in his way, he was a formidable\\nadversary. There was a gala dinner at the Schloss, to celebrate the\\nsigning of the treaty. \"It was the exact repetition of the first, at the\\nopening of the Congress. I sat on the left of Bismarck, and had a good\\ndeal of conversation with him. The Crown Prince and Princess were just\\nopposite, and the Princess talked a great deal with me across the table,\\nalways in English.\" The Crown Princess could never forget that she was\\nborn Princess Royal of England. Her household was managed on English\\nprinciples, her children brought up by English nurses, she herself\\nalways spoke English with them. Of course there must have been many\\nthings in Germany which were distasteful to her,--so many of the small\\nrefinements of life which are absolute necessaries in England were\\nalmost unknown luxuries in Germany,--particularly when she married. Now\\nthere has been a great advance in comfort and even elegance in German\\nhouses and habits. Her English proclivities made her a great many\\nenemies, and I don\\'t believe the \"Iron Chancellor\" made things easy for\\nher. The dinner at the Schloss was as usual at six o\\'clock, and at nine\\nW. had to go to take leave of the Empress, who was very French in her\\nsympathies, and had always been very kind to him. Her daughter, the\\nGrand Duchess of Baden, was there, and W. had a very pleasant hour with\\nthe two ladies. The Empress asked him a great many questions about the\\nCongress, and particularly about Bismarck--if he was in a fairly good\\ntemper--when he had his nerves he was simply impossible, didn\\'t care\\nwhat people thought of him, and didn\\'t hesitate to show when he was\\nbored. The Grand Duchess added smilingly: \"He is perfectly intolerant,\\nhas no patience with a fool.\" I suppose most people are of this opinion.\\nI am not personally. I have some nice, foolish, kindly, happy friends of\\nboth sexes I am always glad to see; I think they are rather resting in\\nthese days of high education and culture and pose. W. finished his\\nevening at Lady Salisbury\\'s, who had a farewell reception for all the\\nplenipotentiaries. He took leave of his colleagues, all of whom had been\\nmost friendly. The only one who was a little stiff with him and\\nexpressed no desire to meet him again was Corti, the Italian\\nplenipotentiary. He suspected of course that something had been arranged\\nabout Tunis, and was much annoyed that he hadn\\'t been able to get\\nTripoli for Italy. He was our colleague afterward in London, and there\\nwas always a little constraint and coolness in his manner. W. left\\nBerlin on the 17th, having been five weeks away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\nGAIETIES AT THE QUAI D\\'ORSAY\\n\\nW. got home on the 17th, and was so busy the first days, with his\\ncolleagues and political friends that I didn\\'t see much more of him than\\nif he had been in Berlin. He was rather disgusted and discouraged at the\\nview his colleagues of the cabinet and his friends took of France\\'s\\nattitude at the Congress. The only man who seemed to be able to look\\nahead a little and understand what a future there might be for France in\\nTunis was Gambetta. I remember quite well his telling of an interesting\\nconversation with him. Gambetta was very keen about foreign affairs,\\nvery patriotic, and not at all willing that France should remain\\nindefinitely a weakened power, still suffering from the defeat of 1870.\\nThere were many fetes and reunions of all kinds, all through the summer\\nmonths, as people had flocked to Paris for the exposition. We remained\\nin town until the first days of August, then W. went to his\\nConseil-General in the Department of the Aisne, and I went down to\\nDeauville. He joined me there, and we had a pleasant month--bathing,\\ndriving, and seeing a great many people. We had taken Sir Joseph\\nOliffe\\'s villa, one of the best in Deauville. Oliffe, an Englishman, was\\none of Emperor Napoleon\\'s physicians, and he and the Duc de Morny were\\nthe founders of Deauville, which was very fashionable as long as Morny\\nlived and the Empire lasted, but it lost its vogue for some years after\\nthe Franco-German War--fashion and society generally congregating at\\nTrouville. There were not many villas then, and one rather bad hotel,\\nbut the sea was nearer than it is now and people all went to the beach\\nin the morning, and fished for shrimps in the afternoon, and led a quiet\\nout-of-doors life. There was no polo nor golf nor automobiles--not many\\ncarriages, a good tennis-court, where W. played regularly, and races\\nevery Sunday in August, which brought naturally a gay young crowd of all\\nthe sporting world. The train des maris that left Paris every Saturday\\nevening, brought a great many men. It was quite different from the\\nDeauville of to-day, which is charming, with quantities of pretty villas\\nand gardens and sports of all kinds, but the sea is so far off one has\\nto take quite a long walk to get to it, and the mornings on the beach\\nand the expeditions to Trouville in the afternoon across the ferry, to\\ndo a little shopping in the rue de Paris, are things of the past.\\nCuriously enough while I was looking over my notes the other day, I had\\na visit from an old friend, the Duc de M., who was one of the inner\\ncircle of the imperial household of the Emperor Napoleon III, and took\\nan active part in all that went on at court. He had just been hearing\\nfrom a friend of the very brilliant season at Deauville this year, and\\nthe streams of gold that flowed into the caisse of the management of the\\nnew hotel and casino. Every possible luxury and every inducement to\\nspend money, racing, gambling, pretty women of all nationalities and\\nfacile character, beautifully dressed and covered with jewels, side by\\nside with the bearers of some of the proudest names in France. He said\\nthat just fifty years ago he went to Deauville with the Duc de Morny,\\nPrincesse Metternich, and the Comtesse de Pourteles to inaugurate the\\nnew watering-place, then of the simplest description. The ladies were\\nbadly lodged in a so-called hotel and he had a room in a\\nfisherman\\'s hut.\\n\\nMarshal MacMahon had a house near Trouville that year, and he came over\\noccasionally to see W., always on horseback and early in the morning. W.\\nused to struggle into his clothes when \"M. le Marechal\" was announced.\\nI think the marshal preferred his military title very much to his civic\\nhonours. I suppose there never was so unwilling a president of a\\nrepublic, except many years later Casimir Perier, who certainly hated\\nthe \"prison of the Elysee,\" but the marshal was a soldier, and his\\nmilitary discipline helped him through many difficult positions. We had\\nvarious visitors who came down for twenty-four hours--one charming visit\\nfrom the Marquis de Vogue, then French ambassador at Vienna, where he\\nwas very much liked, a persona grata in every way. He was very tall,\\ndistinguished-looking, quite the type of the ambassador. When I went to\\ninspect his room I was rather struck by the shortness of the bed--didn\\'t\\nthink his long legs could ever get into it. The valet assured me it was\\nall right, the bed was normal, but I doubt if he had a very comfortable\\nnight. He and W. were old friends, had travelled in the East together\\nand discussed every possible subject during long starlight nights in the\\ndesert. They certainly never thought then that one day they would be\\nclosely associated as ambassador and foreign minister. Vogue didn\\'t like\\nthe Republic, didn\\'t believe in the capacity or the sincerity of the\\nRepublicans--couldn\\'t understand how W. could. He was a personal friend\\nof the marshal\\'s, remained at Vienna during the marshal\\'s presidency,\\nbut left with him, much to W.\\'s regret, who knew what good service he\\nhad done at Vienna and what a difficult post that would be for an\\nimprovised diplomatist. It was then, and I fancy is still, one of the\\nstiffest courts in Europe. One hears amusing stories from some\\ndiplomatists of the rigid etiquette in court circles, which the\\nAmericans were always infringing. A great friend of mine, an American,\\nwho had lived all her life abroad, and whose husband was a member of the\\ndiplomatic corps in Vienna, was always worrying over the misdemeanours\\nof the Americans who never paid any attention to rules or court\\netiquette. They invaded charmed circles, walked boldly up to archdukes\\nand duchesses, talking to them cheerfully and easily without waiting to\\nbe spoken to, giving them a great deal of information upon all subjects,\\nAustrian as well as American, and probably interested the very stiff\\nAustrian royalties much more than the ordinary trained diplomatist, who\\nwould naturally be more correct in his attitude and conversation. I\\nthink the American nationality is the most convenient in the world. The\\nAmericans do just as they like, and no one is ever surprised. The\\nexplanation is quite simple: \"They are Americans.\" I have often noticed\\nlittle faults of manners or breeding, which would shock one in a\\nrepresentative of an older civilisation, pass quite unnoticed, or merely\\nprovoke a smile of amusement.\\n\\nWe drove about a great deal--the country at the back of Deauville, going\\naway from the sea, is lovely--very like England--charming narrow roads\\nwith high banks and hedges on each side--big trees with spreading\\nbranches meeting overhead--stretches of green fields with cows grazing\\nplacidly and horses and colts gambolling about. It is a great grazing\\nand breeding country. There are many haras (breeding stables) in the\\nneighbourhood, and the big Norman posters are much in demand. I have\\nfriends who never take their horses to the country. They hire for the\\nseason a pair of strong Norman horses that go all day up and down hill\\nat the same regular pace and who get over a vast amount of country. We\\nstopped once or twice when we were a large party, two or three\\ncarriages, and had tea at one of the numerous farmhouses that were\\nscattered about. Boiling water was a difficulty--milk, cider, good bread\\nand butter, cheese we could always find--sometimes a galette, but a\\nkettle and boiling water were entirely out of their habits. They used to\\nboil the water in a large black pot, and take it out with a big spoon.\\nHowever, it amused us, and the water really did boil.\\n\\nWe had an Italian friend, Count A., who went with us sometimes, and he\\nwas very debrouillard, made himself delightful at once to the fermiere\\nand got whatever he wanted--chairs and tables set out on the grass, with\\nall the cows and colts and chickens walking about quite undisturbed by\\nthe unusual sights and sounds. It was all very rustic and a delightful\\nchange from the glories of the exposition and official life. It amused\\nme perfectly to see W. with a straw hat, sitting on a rather rickety\\nthree-legged stool, eating bread and butter and jam. Once or twice some\\nof W.\\'s secretaries came down with despatches, and he had a good\\nmorning\\'s work, but on the whole the month passed lazily and pleasantly.\\n\\nWe went back to Paris about the 10th of September, and remained there\\nuntil the end of the exposition. Paris was again crowded with\\nforeigners--the month of October was beautiful, bright and warm, and the\\nafternoons at the exposition were delightful at the end of the day, when\\nthe crowd had dispersed a little and the last rays of the setting sun\\nlingered on the Meudon Hills and the river. The buildings and costumes\\nlost their tawdry look, and one saw only a mass of moving colour, which\\nseemed to soften and lose itself in the evening shadows. There were\\nvarious closing entertainments. The marshal gave a splendid fete at\\nVersailles. We drove out and had some difficulty in making our way\\nthrough the crowd of carriages, soldiers, police, and spectators that\\nlined the road. It was a beautiful sight as we got near the palace,\\nwhich was a blaze of light. The terraces and gardens were also\\nilluminated, and the effect of the little lamps hidden away in the\\nbranches of the old trees, cut into all sorts of fantastic shapes, was\\nquite wonderful. There were not as many people at the entrance of the\\npalace as we had expected to find, for the invitations had been most\\ngenerously given to all nationalities. At first the rooms, which were\\nbrilliantly lighted, looked almost empty. The famous Galerie des Glaces\\nwas quite enchanting, almost too light, if there can be too much light\\nat a fete. There were very few people in it when we arrived rather\\nearly--so much so that when I said to M. de L., one of the marshal\\'s\\naides-de-camp, \"How perfectly beautiful it is, even now, empty; what\\nwill it be when all the uniforms and jewels are reflected in the\\nmirrors,\" his answer was: \"Ah, Madame, I am afraid we shan\\'t have people\\nenough, the hall is so enormous.\"\\n\\nI thought of him afterward when an angry crowd was battering at the\\ndoors of one of the salons where the royalties were having refreshments.\\nI don\\'t think they realised, and we certainly didn\\'t, what the noise\\nmeant, but some of the marshal\\'s household, who knew that only a slight\\ntemporary partition was between us and an irate mob, struggling up the\\nstaircase, were green with anxiety. However, the royalties all got away\\nwithout any difficulty, and we tried to hurry immediately after them,\\nbut a dense crowd was then pouring into the room at each end, and for a\\nmoment things looked ugly. The gentlemen, my husband and my\\nbrother-in-law, Eugene Schuyler, Lord Lyons, British ambassador (a big\\nsquare-shouldered man), and one or two others, put us, my sister\\nSchuyler and me, in a recess of one of the big windows, with heavy\\nfurniture in front of us, but that was not very pleasant--with the crowd\\nmoving both ways closing in upon us--and the men were getting nervous,\\nso one of our secretaries squeezed through the crowd and found two or\\nthree huissiers, came back with them, and we made a procession--two big\\nhuissiers in front, with their silver chains and swords, the mark of\\nofficial status, which always impresses a French crowd, then Lord Lyons,\\nmy sister, and I, then W. and Schuyler, and two more men behind us--and\\nwith considerable difficulty and a good many angry expostulations, we\\nmade our way out. Happily our carriages and servants with our wraps were\\nwaiting in one of the inner courts, and we got away easily enough, but\\nthe evening was disastrous to most of the company.\\n\\nThere must have been some misunderstanding between the marshal\\'s\\nhousehold and the officials at Versailles, as but one staircase (and\\nthere are several) was opened to the public, which was of course\\nabsolutely insufficient. Why others were not opened and lighted will\\nalways be a mystery. Every one got jammed in the one narrow\\nstairway--people jostled and tumbled over each other--some of the women\\nfainted and were carried out, borne high aloft over the heads of the\\nstruggling multitudes, and many people never saw their cloaks again. The\\nvestiaire was taken by storm--satin and lace cloaks lying on the ground,\\ntrampled upon by everybody, and at the end, various men not having been\\nable to find their coats were disporting themselves in pink satin cloaks\\nlined with swan\\'s-down--over their shoulders. Quantities of people never\\ngot into the palace--not even on the staircase. The landing was directly\\nopposite the room where the princes had their buffet--and if they had\\nsucceeded in forcing the door, it would have been a catastrophe. While\\nwe were standing in the window, looking into the park, which looked an\\nenchanted garden, with the lights and flowers--we wondered if we could\\njump or climb down if the crowd pressed too much upon us, but it was too\\nhigh and there were no projecting balconies to serve as stepping-stones.\\nIt was a very unpleasant experience.\\n\\nWe were giving a ball at the Quai d\\'Orsay a few nights afterward, and\\nhad also asked a great many people--all the ambassadors sent in very\\nlarge lists of invitations they wanted for their compatriots, but much\\nthe largest was that sent in by the American minister. The invitations\\nsent to the United States Legation (as it was then) were something\\nfabulous. It seemed to me the whole of the United States were in Paris\\nand expecting to be entertained. It is a very difficult position for the\\nAmerican representative on these occasions. Everybody can\\'t be invited\\nto the various entertainments and distinctions are very hard to make. We\\nhad some amusing experiences. W. had a letter from one of his English\\nfriends, Lord H., saying he was coming to Paris for the fetes, with his\\ntwo daughters, and he would like very much to be invited to some of the\\nparties at the Elysee and the ministries. W. replied, saying he would\\ndo what he could, and added that we were to have two large dinners and\\nreceptions,--one with the Comedie Francaise afterward and one with\\nmusic--which one would they come to. Lord H. promptly replied, \"to\\nboth.\" It was funny, but really didn\\'t make any difference. When you\\nhave a hundred people to dinner you can quite easily have a hundred and\\nthree, and in such large parties, arranged weeks beforehand, some one\\nalways gives out at the last moment.\\n\\nWe had a great many discussions in W.\\'s cabinet with two of his\\nsecretaries, who were especially occupied with the invitations for our\\nball. The Parliament of course (le peuple souverain) was invited, but it\\nwas a different question for the women, wives of the senators and\\ndeputies. We finally arrived at a solution by inviting only the wives I\\nknew. We had an indignant response from one gentleman: \"M. X., Depute,\\nne valsant qu\\'avec sa femme, a l\\'honneur de renvoyer la carte\\nd\\'invitation que le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres et Madame\\nWaddington lui ont adressee pour la soiree du 28....\" (Mr. X., Deputy,\\nwho waltzes only with his wife, has the honour to send back the card of\\ninvitation which the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Madame Waddington\\nhave sent to him for the party of the 28... ) It was unanimously\\ndecided that the couple must be invited--a gentleman who went to balls\\nonly to dance with his wife must be encouraged in such exemplary\\nbehaviour. Another was funny too, in a different style: \"Madame K.,\\netant au ciel depuis quelques annees, ne pourrait pas se rendre a la\\ngracieuse invitation que le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres et Madame\\nWaddington ont bien voulu lui adresser. Monsieur K. s\\'y rendra avec\\nplaisir.\"... (Madame K., being in heaven for some years, cannot accept\\nthe amiable invitation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Madame\\nWaddington. Mr. K. will come with pleasure.) We kept the letters in our\\narchives with many other curious specimens. The house was given over to\\nworkmen the last two or three days before the ball. With the remembrance\\nof the staircase at Versailles in our minds, we were most anxious to\\nhave no contretemps of any kind to interfere with our entertainment.\\nBoth entrances were arranged and the old elevator (which had not worked\\nfor years) was put in order. It had been suggested once or twice that I\\nshould use it, but as I always had heard a gruesome tale of Madame\\nDrouyn de l\\'Huys, when her husband was Foreign Minister, hanging in\\nspace for four or five hours between the two floors, I was not inclined\\nto repeat that experience.\\n\\nMy recollection of the lower entrance and staircase, which we never\\nused, was of rather a dark, grimy corner, and I was amazed the morning\\nof the ball to see the transformation. Draperies, tapestries, flags, and\\ngreen plants had done wonders--and the elevator looked quite charming\\nwith red velvet hangings and cushions. I don\\'t think any one used it. We\\nhad asked our guests at nine-thirty, as the princes said they would come\\nat ten. I was ready about nine, and thought I would go down-stairs by\\nthe lower entrance, so as to have a look at the staircase and all the\\nrooms before any one came. There was already such a crowd in the rooms\\nthat I couldn\\'t get through; even my faithful Gerard could not make a\\npassage. We were obliged to send for two huissiers, who with some\\ndifficulty made room for me. W. and his staff were already in the salon\\nreserve, giving final instructions. The servants told us that since\\neight o\\'clock there had been a crowd at the doors, which they opened a\\nlittle before nine, and a flood of people poured in. The salon reserve\\nhad a blue ribbon stretched across the entrance from door to door, and\\nwas guarded by huissiers, old hands who knew everybody in the diplomatic\\nand official world, and would not let any one in who hadn\\'t a right to\\npenetrate into the charmed circle (which of course became the one room\\nwhere every one wanted to go). There were, too, one or two members of\\nW.\\'s cabinet always stationed near the doors to see that instructions\\nwere obeyed.\\n\\nI don\\'t think the salon reserve exists any more--the blue ribbon\\ncertainly not. The rising flood of democracy and equality wouldn\\'t\\nsubmit to any such barrier. I remember quite well one beautiful woman\\nstanding for some time just the wrong side of the ribbon. She was so\\nbeautiful that every one remarked her, but she had no official rank or\\nclaim of any kind to enter the salon reserve--no one knew her, though\\nevery one was asking who she was. She finally made her entree into the\\nroom on the arm of one of the members of the diplomatic corps, a young\\nsecretary, one of her friends, who could not refuse her what she wanted\\nso much. She was certainly the handsomest woman in the room with the\\nexception of the actual Queen Alexandra, who was always the most\\nbeautiful and distinguished wherever she was.\\n\\nThe royalties didn\\'t dance much. We had the regular quadrille d\\'honneur\\nwith the Princes and Princesses of Wales, Denmark, Sweden, Countess of\\nFlanders, and others. None of the French princes came to the ball.\\nThere was a great crowd, but as the distinguished guests remained all\\nthe time in the salon reserve, they were not inconvenienced by it. Just\\nbefore supper, which was served at little round tables in a room opening\\nout of the rotonde, the late King of Denmark, then Crown Prince, brother\\nof the Princess of Wales, told me he would like to go up-stairs and see\\nall the rooms; he had always heard that the Palais d\\'Orsay was a\\nbeautiful house. We made a difficult but stately progress through the\\nrooms. The staircase was a pretty sight, covered with a red carpet,\\ntapestries on the walls, and quantities of pretty women of all\\nnationalities grouped on the steps. We walked through the rooms, where\\nthere were just as many people as there were down-stairs, an orchestra,\\nsupper-room, people dancing--just like another party going on. We halted\\na few minutes in my petit salon at the end of the long suite of rooms.\\nIt looked quite charming, with the blue brocade walls and quantities of\\npink roses standing in high glass vases. I suggested taking the elevator\\nto go down, but the prince preferred walking (so did I). It was even\\nmore difficult getting through the crowd down-stairs--we had the whole\\nlength of the house to cross. Several women stood on chairs as we passed\\nalong, in the hope of seeing one of the princesses, but they had wisely\\nremained in the salon reserve, and were afraid to venture into\\nthe crowd.\\n\\nSupper was a serious preoccupation for the young secretaries of the\\nministry, who had much difficulty in keeping that room private. Long\\nbefore the supper hour some enterprising spirits had discovered that the\\nroyalties were to sup in that room, and finding the secretaries quite\\ninaccessible to any suggestions of \"people who had a right to come\\nin\"--presidents of commissions and various other distinctions--had\\nrecourse to the servants, and various gold pieces circulated, which,\\nhowever, did not accomplish their object. The secretaries said that they\\nhad more trouble with the chamberlains of the various princes than with\\nthe princes themselves; they all wanted to sup in the private room, and\\nwere much more tenacious of having a good place, or the place they\\nthought was due to them, than their royal masters. The supper was very\\ngay--the Prince of Wales (the late King Edward) perfectly\\ncharming--talking to every one, remembering every one with that\\nextraordinary gracious manner which made him friends in all classes.\\nImmediately after supper the princes and distinguished strangers and W.\\ndeparted. I remained about an hour longer and went to have a look at\\nthe ballroom. It was still crowded, people dancing hard, and when\\nfinally about two o\\'clock I retreated to my own quarters, I went to\\nsleep to the sound of waltzes and dance music played by the two\\norchestras. The revelry continued pretty well all through the night.\\nWhenever I woke I heard strains of music. Supper went on till seven in\\nthe morning. Our faithful Kruft told us that there was absolutely\\nnothing left on the tables, and they had almost to force the people out,\\ntelling them that an invitation to a ball did not usually extend to\\nbreakfast the next morning.\\n\\nThere was a grand official closing of the exposition at the end of\\nNovember, with a distribution of prizes--the city still very full and\\nvery gay--escorts and uniforms in every direction--the Champs-Elysees\\nbrilliant with soldiers--equipages of all descriptions, and all the\\nafternoon a crowd of people sitting under the trees, much interested in\\nall that was going on, particularly when carriages would pass with\\npeople in foreign and striking costumes. The Chinese always wore their\\ncostume; the big yellow birds of paradise became quite a feature of the\\nafternoon defile. An Indian princess too, dressed entirely in white--a\\nsoft clinging material, with a white veil, _not_ over her face, and\\nheld in place by a gold band going around the head--was always much\\nadmired. Every now and then there would be a great clatter of\\ntrotting-horses and jingling sabres, when an escort of dragoons would\\npass, escorting some foreign prince to the Elysee to pay his formal\\nvisit to the marshal. Everybody looked gay--French people so dearly love\\na show--and it was amusing to see the interest every one took in the\\nsteady stream of people, from the fashionable woman driving to the Bois\\nin her victoria to the workmen, who would stand in groups on the corners\\nof the streets--some of them occasionally with a child on their\\nshoulders. Frenchmen of all classes are good to children. On a Sunday or\\nfete day, when whole families are coming in from a day at the Bois, one\\noften sees a young husband wheeling a baby-carriage, or carrying a baby\\nin his arms to let the poor mother have a rest. It was curious at the\\nend of the exposition to see how quickly everything was removed (many\\nthings had been sold); and in a few days the Champ de Mars took again\\nthe same aspect it had at the beginning of the month of May--heavy carts\\nand camions everywhere, oceans of mud, lines of black holes where trees\\nand poles had been planted, and the same groups of small shivering\\nSoutherners, all huddled together, wrapped in wonderful cloaks and\\nblankets, quite paralysed with cold. I don\\'t know if the exposition was\\na financial success--I should think probably not. A great deal of money\\ncame into France (but the French spent enormously in their preparations)\\nbut the moral effect was certainly good--all the world flocked to Paris.\\nCabs and river steamers did a flourishing business, as did all the\\nrestaurants and cafes in the suburbs. St. Cloud, Meudon, Versailles,\\nRobinson, were crowded every night with people who were thirsting for\\nair and food after long hot days in the dust and struggles of the\\nexposition. We dined there once or twice, but it was certainly neither\\npleasant nor comfortable--even in the most expensive restaurants. They\\nwere all overcrowded, very bad service, badly lighted, and generally bad\\nfood. There were various national repasts--Russian, Italian, etc.--but I\\nnever participated in any of those, except once at the American\\nrestaurant, where I had a very good breakfast one morning, with\\ndelicious waffles made by a negro cook. I was rather glad when the\\nexhibition was over. One had a feeling that one ought to see as much as\\npossible, and there were some beautiful things, but it was most\\nfatiguing struggling through the crowd, and we invariably lost the\\ncarriage and found ourselves at the wrong entrance, and had to wait\\nhours for a cab. Tiffany had a great success with the French. Many of my\\nfriends bought souvenirs of the exposition from him. His work was very\\noriginal, fanciful, and quite different from the rather stiff, heavy,\\nclassic silver that one sees in this country.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\nM. WADDINGTON AS PRIME MINISTER\\n\\nThere had been a respite, a sort of armed truce, in political circles as\\nlong as the exposition lasted, but when the Chambers met again in\\nNovember, it was evident that things were not going smoothly. The\\nRepublicans and Radicals were dissatisfied. Every day there were\\nspeeches and insinuations against the marshal and his government, and\\none felt that a crisis was impending. There were not loaves and fishes\\nenough for the whole Radical party. If one listened to them it would\\nseem as if every prefet and every general were conspiring against the\\nRepublic. There were long consultations in W.\\'s cabinet, and I went\\noften to our house in the rue Dumont d\\'Urville to see if everything was\\nin order there, as I quite expected to be back there for Christmas. A\\nclimax was reached when the marshal was asked to sign the deposition of\\nsome of the generals. He absolutely refused--the ministers persisted in\\ntheir demands. There was not much discussion, the marshal\\'s mind was\\nmade up, and on the 30th of January, 1879, he announced in the Conseil\\ndes Ministres his irrevocable decision, and handed his ministers his\\nletter of resignation.\\n\\nWe had a melancholy breakfast--W., Count de P., and I--the last day of\\nthe marshal\\'s presidency. W. was very blue, was quite sure the marshal\\nwould resign, and foresaw all sorts of complications both at home and\\nabroad. The day was gloomy too, grey and cold, even the big rooms of the\\nministry were dark. As soon as they had started for Versailles, I took\\nbaby and went to mother\\'s. As I went over the bridge I wondered how many\\nmore times I should cross it, and whether the end of the week would see\\nme settled again in my own house. We drove about and had tea together,\\nand I got back to the Quai d\\'Orsay about six o\\'clock. Neither W. nor\\nCount de P. had got back from Versailles, but there were two\\ntelegrams--the first one to say that the marshal had resigned, the\\nsecond one that Grevy was named in his place, with a large majority.\\n\\n[Illustration: M. Jules Grevy, reading Marshal MacMahon\\'s letter of\\nresignation to the Chamber of Deputies. From _L\\'Illustration_,\\nFebruary 8. 1879.]\\n\\nW. was rather depressed when he came home--he had always a great\\nsympathy and respect for the marshal, and was very sorry to see him\\ngo,--thought his departure would complicate foreign affairs. As long as\\nthe marshal was at the Elysee, foreign governments were not afraid of\\ncoups d\\'etat or revolutions. He was also sorry that Dufaure would not\\nremain, but he was an old man, had had enough of political life and\\nparty struggles--left the field to younger men. The marshal\\'s letter was\\ncommunicated at once to the Parliament, and the houses met in the\\nafternoon. There was a short session to hear the marshal\\'s letter read\\n(by Grevy in the Chamber of Deputies) and the two houses, Senate and\\nChamber of Deputies, were convoked for a later hour of the same\\nafternoon. There was not much excitement, two or three names were\\npronounced, but every one felt sure that Grevy would be the man. He was\\nnominated by a large majority, and the Republicans were\\njubilant--thought the Republic was at last established on a firm and\\nproper basis. Grevy was perfectly calm and self-possessed--did not show\\nmuch enthusiasm. He must have felt quite sure from the first moment that\\nhe would be named. His first visitor was the marshal, who wished him all\\npossible success in his new mission, and, if Grevy was pleased to be the\\nPresident of the Republic, the marshal was even more pleased not to be,\\nand to take up his private life again.\\n\\nThere were many speculations as to who would be charged by Grevy to form\\nhis first cabinet--and almost permanent meetings in all the groups of\\nthe Left. W.\\'s friends all said he would certainly remain at the Foreign\\nOffice, but that depended naturally upon the choice of the premier. If\\nhe were taken from the more advanced ranks of the Left, W. could not\\npossibly stay. We were not long in suspense. W. had one or two\\ninterviews with Grevy, which resulted in his remaining at the Foreign\\nOffice, but as prime minister. W. hesitated at first, felt that it would\\nnot be an easy task to keep all those very conflicting elements\\ntogether. There were four Protestants in the ministry, W., Leon Say, de\\nFreycinet, and Le Royer. Jules Ferry, who took the Ministry of Public\\nInstruction, a very clever man, was practically a freethinker, and the\\nParliament was decidedly more advanced. The last elections had given a\\nstrong Republican majority to the Senate. He consulted with his brother,\\nRichard Waddington, then a deputy, afterward a senator, president of the\\nChamber of Commerce of Rouen, and some of his friends, and finally\\ndecided to accept the very honourable, but very onerous position, and\\nremained at the Foreign Affairs with Grevy, as prime minister.\\n\\nIf I had seen little of him before, I saw nothing of him now, as his\\nwork was exactly doubled. We did breakfast together, but it was a most\\nirregular meal--sometimes at twelve o\\'clock, sometimes at one-thirty,\\nand very rarely alone. We always dined out or had people dining with us,\\nso that family life became a dream of the past. We very rarely went\\ntogether when we dined out. W. was always late--his coupe waited hours\\nin the court. I had my carriage and went alone. After eight or ten days\\nof irregular meals at impossible hours (we often dined at nine-thirty) I\\nsaid to Count de P., W.\\'s chef de cabinet: \"Can\\'t you arrange to have\\nbusiness over a little earlier? It is awful to dine so late and to wait\\nso long,\" to which he replied: \"Ah, madame, no one can be more desirous\\nthan I to change that order of things, for when the minister dines at\\nnine-thirty, the chef de cabinet gets his dinner at ten-thirty.\" We did\\nmanage to get rather more satisfactory hours after a little while, but\\nit was always difficult to extract W. from his work if it were anything\\nimportant. He became absorbed, and absolutely unconscious of time.\\n\\nThe new President, Grevy, installed himself at once at the Elysee with\\nhis wife and daughter. There was much speculation about Madame Grevy--no\\none had ever seen her--she was absolutely unknown. When Grevy was\\npresident of the National Assembly, he gave very pleasant men\\'s\\ndinners, where Madame Grevy never appeared. Every one (of all opinions)\\nwas delighted to go to him, and the talk was most brilliant and\\ninteresting. Grevy was a perfect host, very cultivated, with a\\nmarvellous memory--quoting pages of the classics, French, and Latin.\\n\\nMadame Grevy was always spoken of as a quiet, unpretending\\nperson--occupied with domestic duties, who hated society and never went\\nanywhere--in fact, no one ever heard her name mentioned. A great many\\npeople didn\\'t know that Grevy had a wife. When her husband became\\nPresident of the Republic, there was much discussion as to Madame\\nGrevy\\'s social status in the official world. I don\\'t think Grevy wanted\\nher to appear nor to take any part in the new life, and she certainly\\ndidn\\'t want to. Nothing in her former life had prepared her for such a\\nchange, and it was always an effort for her, but both were overruled by\\ntheir friends, who thought a woman was a necessary part of the position.\\nIt was some little time before they were settled at the Elysee. W. asked\\nGrevy once or twice when Madame Waddington might call upon his wife--and\\nhe answered that as soon as they were quite installed I should receive a\\nnotice. One day a communication arrived from the Elysee, saying that\\nMadame Grevy would receive the diplomatic corps and the ministers\\' wives\\non a fixed day at five o\\'clock. The message was sent on to the\\ndiplomatic corps, and when I arrived on the appointed day (early, as I\\nwanted to see the people come in, and also thought I must present the\\nforeign ladies) there were already several carriages in the court.\\n\\n[Illustration: M. Jules Grevy elected President of the Republic by the\\nSenate and Chamber of Deputies meeting as the National Assembly. From\\n_l\\'Illustration_, February 8. 1879.]\\n\\nThe Elysee looked just as it did in the marshal\\'s time--plenty of\\nservants in gala liveries--two or three huissiers who knew\\neverybody--palms, flowers, everywhere. The traditions of the palace are\\ncarried on from one President to another, and a permanent staff of\\nservants remains. We found Madame Grevy with her daughter and one or two\\nladies, wives, I suppose, of the secretaries, seated in the well-known\\ndrawing-room with the beautiful tapestries--Madame Grevy in a large gold\\narmchair at the end of the room--a row of gilt armchairs on each side of\\nhers--mademoiselle standing behind her mother. A huissier announced\\nevery one distinctly, but the names and titles said nothing to Madame\\nGrevy. She was tall, middle-aged, handsomely dressed, and visibly\\nnervous--made a great many gestures when she talked. It was amusing to\\nsee all the people arrive. I had nothing to do--there were no\\nintroductions--every one was announced, and they all walked straight up\\nto Madame Grevy, who was very polite, got up for every one, men and\\nwomen. It was rather an imposing circle that gathered around\\nher--Princess Hohenlohe, German ambassadress, sat on one side of\\nher--Marquise Molins, Spanish ambassadress, on the other. There were not\\nmany men--Lord Lyons, as doyen of the diplomatic corps, the nonce, and a\\ngood many representatives of the South American Republics. Madame Grevy\\nwas perfectly bewildered, and did try to talk to the ladies next to her,\\nbut it was an intimidating function for any one, and she had no one to\\nhelp her, as they were all quite new to the work. It was obviously an\\nimmense relief to her when some lady of the official world came in, whom\\nshe had known before. The two ladies plunged at once into a very\\nanimated conversation about their children, husbands, and various\\ndomestic matters--a perfectly natural conversation, but not interesting\\nto the foreign ladies.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t make a very long visit--it was merely a matter of form. Lord\\nLyons came out with me, and we had quite a talk while I was waiting for\\nmy carriage in the anteroom. He was so sensible always in his\\nintercourse with the official world, quite realised that the position\\nwas difficult and trying for Madame Grevy--it would have been for any\\none thrown at once without any preparation into such perfectly different\\nsurroundings. He had a certain experience of republics and republican\\nmanners, as he had been some years in Washington as British minister,\\nand had often seen wives of American statesmen and ministers, fresh from\\nthe far West, beginning their career in Washington, quite bewildered by\\nthe novelty of everything and utterly ignorant of all questions of\\netiquette--only he said the American women were far more adaptable than\\neither French or English--or than any others in the world, in fact. He\\nalso said that day, and I have heard him repeat it once or twice since,\\nthat he had _never_ met a stupid American woman....\\n\\nI have always thought it was unnecessary to insist upon Madame Grevy\\'s\\npresence at the Elysee. It is very difficult for any woman, no longer\\nvery young, to begin an entirely new life in a perfectly different\\nmilieu, and certainly more difficult for a Frenchwoman of the\\nbourgeoisie than any other. They live in such a narrow circle, their\\nlives are so cramped and uninteresting--they know so little of society\\nand foreign ways and manners that they must be often uncomfortable and\\nmake mistakes. It is very different for a man. All the small questions\\nof dress and manners, etc., don\\'t exist for him. One man in a dress coat\\nand white cravat looks very like another, and men of all conditions are\\npolite to a lady. When a man is intelligent, no one notices whether his\\ncoat and waist-coat are too wide or too short and whether his boots\\nare clumsy.\\n\\nMadame Grevy never looked happy at the Elysee. They had a big dinner\\nevery Thursday, with a reception afterward, and she looked so tired when\\nshe was sitting on the sofa, in the diplomatic salon, making\\nconversation for the foreigners and people of all kinds who came to\\ntheir receptions, that one felt really sorry for her. Grevy was always a\\nstriking personality. He had a fine head, a quiet, dignified manner, and\\nlooked very well when he stood at the door receiving his guests. I don\\'t\\nthink he cared very much about foreign affairs--he was essentially\\nFrench--had never lived abroad or known any foreigners. He was too\\nintelligent not to understand that a country must have foreign\\nrelations, and that France must take her place again as a great power,\\nbut home politics interested him much more than anything else. He was a\\ncharming talker--every one wanted to talk to him, or rather to listen to\\nhim. The evenings were pleasant enough in the diplomatic salon. It was\\ninteresting to see the attitude of the different diplomatists. All were\\ncorrect, but most of them were visibly antagonistic to the Republic and\\nthe Republicans (which they considered much accentuee since the\\nnomination of Grevy--the women rather more so than the men). One felt,\\nif one didn\\'t hear, the criticisms on the dress, deportment, and general\\nstyle of the Republican ladies.\\n\\n[Illustration: The Elysee Palace, Paris]\\n\\nI didn\\'t quite understand their view of the situation. They were all\\ndelighted to come to Paris, and knew perfectly well the state of things,\\nwhat an abyss existed between all the Conservative party, Royalists and\\nBonapartists, and the Republican, but the absence of a court didn\\'t make\\nany difference in their position. They went to all the entertainments\\ngiven in the Faubourg St. Germain, and all the societe came to theirs.\\nWith very few exceptions they did only what was necessary in the way of\\nintercourse with the official world. I think they made a mistake, both\\nfor themselves and their governments. France was passing through an\\nentirely new phase; everything was changing, many young intelligent men\\nwere coming to the front, and there were interesting and able\\ndiscussions in the Chambers, and in the salons of the Republican\\nministers and deputies. I dare say the new theories of liberty and\\nequality were not sympathetic to the trained representatives of courts,\\nbut the world was advancing, democracy was in the air, and one would\\nhave thought it would have interested foreigners to follow the movement\\nand to judge for themselves whether the young Republic had any chance of\\nlife. One can hardly imagine a public man not wishing to hear all sides\\nof a question, but I think, _certainly_ in the beginning, there was such\\na deep-rooted distrust and dislike to the Republic, that it was\\nimpossible to see things fairly. I don\\'t know that it mattered very\\nmuch. In these days of rapid travelling and telephone, an ambassador\\'s\\nrole is much less important than in the old days when an ambassador with\\nhis numerous suite of secretaries and servants, travelling by post,\\nwould be days on the road before reaching his destination, and when all\\nsorts of things might happen, kingdoms and dynasties be overthrown in\\nthe interval. Now all the great measures and negotiations are discussed\\nand settled in the various chancelleries--the ambassador merely\\ntransmits his instructions.\\n\\nI think the women were rather more uncompromising than the men. One day\\nin my drawing-room there was a lively political discussion going on, and\\none heard all the well-known phrases \"le gouvernement infect,\" \"no\\ngentleman could serve the Republic,\" etc. I wasn\\'t paying much\\nattention--never did; I had become accustomed to that style of\\nconversation, and knew exactly what they were all going to say, when I\\nheard one of my friends, an American-born, married to a Frenchman of\\nvery good old family, make the following statement: \"Toute la canaille\\nest Republicaine.\" That was really too much, and I answered: \"Vous etes\\nbien indulgente pour l\\'Empire.\" When one thinks of the unscrupulous (not\\nto use a stronger term) and needy adventurers, who made the Coup d\\'Etat\\nand played a great part in the court of the Second Empire, it was really\\na little startling to be told that the Republicans enjoyed the monopoly\\nof the canaille. However, I suppose nothing is so useless as a political\\ndiscussion (except perhaps a religious one). No one ever converts any\\none else. I have always heard it said that the best political speech\\nnever changed a vote.\\n\\nThe first person who entertained Grevy was Prince Hohenlohe, the German\\nambassador. They had a brilliant reception, rooms crowded, all the\\nofficial world and a fair contingent from the Faubourg St. Germain. The\\nPresident brought his daughter with him (Madame Grevy never accepted any\\ninvitations) and they walked through the rooms arm-in-arm, mademoiselle\\ndeclining the arm of Count Wesdehlen, first secretary of the\\nGerman Embassy.\\n\\nHowever, she was finally prevailed upon to abandon the paternal support,\\nand then Wesdehlen installed her in a small salon where Mollard,\\nIntroducteur des Ambassadeurs, took charge of her and introduced a great\\nmany men to her. No woman would ask to be introduced to an unmarried\\nwoman, and that of course made her position difficult. The few ladies\\nshe had already seen at the Elysee came up to speak to her, but didn\\'t\\nstay near her, so she was really receiving almost alone with Mollard.\\nGrevy was in another room, tres entoure, as he always was. The\\ndiplomatic corps did not spare their criticisms. Madame Grevy received\\nevery Saturday in the afternoon, and I went often--not every time. It\\nwas a funny collection of people, some queerly dressed women and one or\\ntwo men in dress coats and white cravats,--always a sprinkling of\\ndiplomatists. Prince Orloff was often there, and if anybody could have\\nmade that stiff, shy semicircle of women comfortable, he would have done\\nit, with his extraordinary ease of manner and great habit of the world.\\nGambetta was installed in the course of the month at the Palais Bourbon,\\nnext to us. It was brilliantly lighted every night, and my chef told me\\none of his friends, an excellent cook, was engaged, and that there would\\nbe a great many dinners. The Palais Bourbon had seen great\\nentertainments in former days, when the famous Duc de Morny was\\nPresident de la Chambre des Deputes. Under Napoleon III his\\nentertainments were famous. The whole world, fashionable, political, and\\ndiplomatic thronged his salons, and invitations were eagerly sought for\\nnot only by the French people, but by the many foreigners who passed\\nthrough Paris at that time. Gambetta must have been a curious contrast\\nto the Duc de Morny.\\n\\nWe went to see a first function at the Elysee some time in February, two\\nCardinals were to be named and Grevy was to deliver the birettas.\\nMollard asked to see me one morning, telling me that the two ablegates\\nwith their suite had arrived, and wished to pay their respects to me.\\nOne of them was Monsignor Cataldi, whom we had known well in Rome when\\nwe were living there. He was a friend of my brother (General Rufus King,\\nthe last United States minister to the Vatican under Pia Nono), and came\\noften to the house. He was much excited when he found out that Madame\\nWaddington was the Mary King he had known so well in Rome. He had with\\nhim an English priest, whose name, curiously enough, was English. They\\nappeared about tea-time and were quite charming, Cataldi just as fat and\\ncheerful and talkative as I remembered him in the old days in Rome. We\\nplunged at once into all sorts of memories of old times--the good old\\ntimes when Rome was small and black and interesting--something quite\\napart and different from any other place in the world. Monsignor English\\nwas much younger and more reserved, the Anglo-Saxon type--a contrast to\\nthe exuberant Southerners. We asked them to dine the next night and were\\nable to get a few interesting people to meet them, Comte et Comtesse de\\nSartiges, and one or two deputies--bien-pensants. Sartiges was formerly\\nFrench ambassador in Rome to the Vatican, and a very clever diplomatist.\\nHe was very autocratic, did exactly what he liked. I remember quite well\\nsome of his small dances at the embassy. The invitations were from ten\\nto twelve, and at twelve precisely the musicians stopped playing--no\\nmatter who was dancing, the ball was over. His wife was an American,\\nfrom Boston, Miss Thorndike, who always retained the simple, natural\\nmanner of the well-born American. Their son, the Vicomte de Sartiges,\\nhas followed in his father\\'s footsteps, and is one of the most serious\\nand intelligent of the young diplomatists.\\n\\nCataldi made himself very agreeable, spoke French perfectly well, though\\nwith a strong Italian accent. He confided to me after dinner that he\\nwould have liked to see some of the more advanced political men, instead\\nof the very conservative Catholics we had invited to meet them. \"I know\\nwhat these gentlemen think; I would like to talk to some of the others,\\nthose who think \\'le clericalism c\\'est l\\'ennemi,\\' and who are firmly\\nconvinced that the soutane serves as a cloak for all sorts of underhand\\nand unpatriotic dealings; I can only see them abroad, never in Rome.\" He\\nwould have talked to them quite easily. Italians have so much natural\\ntact, in discussing difficult questions, never irritate people\\nunnecessarily.\\n\\nW. enjoyed his evening. He had never been in Rome, nor known many\\nRomans, and it amused him to see how skilfully Cataldi (who was a\\ndevoted admirer of Leo XIII) avoided all cross-currents and difficult\\nquestions, saying only what he intended to say, and appreciating all\\nthat was said to him.\\n\\nHenrietta and I were very anxious to see the ceremony at the Elysee, and\\nasked Mollard, Introducteur des Ambassadeurs and chef du Protocole--a\\nmost important man on all official occasions, if he couldn\\'t put us\\nsomewhere in a corner, where we could see, without taking any part. W.\\nwas of no use to us, as he went officially, in uniform. Madame Grevy was\\nvery amiable, and sent us an invitation to breakfast. We found a small\\nparty assembled in the tapestry salon when we arrived at the Elysee--the\\nPresident with all his household, civil and military, Madame and\\nMademoiselle Grevy, three or four ladies, wives of the aides-de-camp and\\nsecretaries, also several prominent ecclesiastics, among them Monsignor\\nCapel, an English priest, a very handsome and attractive man, whom we\\nhad known well in Rome. He was supposed to have made more women converts\\nto Catholicism than any man of his time; I can quite understand his\\ninfluence with women. There was something very natural and earnest about\\nhim--no pose. I had not seen him since I had married and was very\\npleased when I recognised him. He told me he had never seen W.--was most\\nanxious to make his acquaintance.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, W. came in, looking very warm and uncomfortable,\\nwearing his stiff, gold-embroidered uniform, which changed him very\\nmuch. I introduced Capel to him at once. They had quite a talk before\\nthe Archbishops and ablegates arrived. The two future Cardinals,\\nMonseigneur Pie, Archbishop of Poitiers, and Monseigneur Desprey,\\nArchbishop of Toulouse, were well known in the Catholic world. The\\nPope\\'s choice was generally approved. They were treated with all due\\nceremony, as befitted princes of the church. One of the Elysee carriages\\n(always very well turned out), with an escort of cavalry, went to fetch\\nthem, and they looked very stately and imposing in their robes when they\\ncame into the room where we were waiting. They were very different,\\nMonseigneur Pie tall, thin, cold, arrogant,--one felt it was a trial for\\nhim to receive his Cardinal\\'s hat from the hands of a Republican\\nPresident. Monseigneur Desprey had a kind good expression. I don\\'t think\\nhe liked it much either, but he put a better face on the matter.\\n\\nBoth Cardinals said exactly what one imagined they would say--that the\\ntraditional fidelity of France to the church should be supported and\\nencouraged in every way in these troubled days of indifference to\\nreligion, etc. One felt all the time the strong antagonism of the church\\nto the Republic. Grevy answered extremely well, speaking with much\\ndignity and simplicity, and assuring the Cardinals that they could\\nalways count upon the constitutional authority of the head of the state,\\nin favour of the rights of the church. I was quite pleased to see again\\nthe red coats and high boots of the gardes nobles. It is a very showy,\\ndashing uniform. The two young men were good-looking and wore it very\\nwell. I asked to have them presented to me, and we had a long talk over\\nold days in Rome when the Pope went out every day to the different\\nvillas, and promenades, and always with an escort of gardes nobles. I\\ninvited them to our reception two or three nights afterward, and they\\nseemed to enjoy themselves. They were, of course, delighted with their\\nshort stay in Paris, and I think a little surprised at the party at the\\nForeign Office under a Republican regime. I don\\'t know if they expected\\nto find the rooms filled with gentlemen in the traditional red\\nGaribaldian shirt--and ladies in corresponding simplicity of attire.\\n\\n[Illustration: Her Majesty Queen Victoria, about 1879. From a photograph\\nby Chancellor, Dublin.]\\n\\nWe saw a great many English at the Quai d\\'Orsay. Queen Victoria stayed\\none or two nights at the British Embassy, passing through Paris on her\\nway South. She sent for W., who had never seen her since his\\nundergraduate days at Cambridge. He found her quite charming, very easy,\\ninterested in everything. She began the conversation in French--(he was\\nannounced with all due ceremony as Monsieur le Ministre des Affaires\\nEtrangeres) and W. said she spoke it remarkably well,--then, with her\\nbeautiful smile which lightened up her whole face: \"I think I can\\nspeak English with a Cambridge scholar.\" She was much interested in his\\nbeginnings in England at Rugby and Cambridge--and was evidently\\nastonished, though she had too much tact to show it, that he had chosen\\nto make his life and career in France instead of accepting the\\nproposition made to him by his cousin Waddington, then Dean of Durham,\\nto remain in England and continue his classic and literary studies under\\nhis guidance. When the interview was over he found the Queen\\'s faithful\\nScotch retainer, John Brown, who always accompanied her everywhere,\\nwaiting outside the door, evidently hoping to see the minister. He spoke\\na few words with him, as a countryman--W. being half Scotch--his mother\\nwas born Chisholm. They shook hands and John Brown begged him to come to\\nScotland, where he would receive a hearty welcome. W. was very pleased\\nwith his reception by the Queen. Lord Lyons told him afterward that she\\nhad been very anxious to see him; she told him later, in speaking of the\\ninterview, that it was very difficult to realise that she was speaking\\nto a French minister--everything about him was so absolutely English,\\nfigure, colouring, and speech.\\n\\nMany old school and college experiences were evoked that year by the\\nvarious English who passed through Paris. One night at a big dinner at\\nthe British Embassy I was sitting next to the Prince of Wales (late King\\nEdward). He said to me: \"There is an old friend of your husband\\'s here\\nto-night, who will be so glad to see him again. They haven\\'t met since\\nhe was his fag at Rugby.\" After dinner he was introduced to me--Admiral\\nGlynn--a charming man, said his last recollection of W. was making his\\ntoast for him and getting a good cuff when the toast fell into the fire\\nand got burnt. The two men talked together for some time in the\\nsmoking-room, recalling all sorts of schoolboy exploits. Another school\\nfriend was Sir Francis Adams, first secretary and \"counsellor\" at the\\nBritish Embassy. When the ambassador took his holiday, Adams replaced\\nhim, and had the rank and title of minister plenipotentiary. He came\\nevery Wednesday, the diplomatic reception day, to the Quai d\\'Orsay to\\ntalk business. As long as a secretary or a huissier was in the room,\\nthey spoke to each other most correctly in French; as soon as they were\\nalone, relapsed into easy and colloquial English. We were very fond of\\nAdams--saw a great deal of him not only in Paris, but when we first\\nlived in London at the embassy. He died suddenly in Switzerland, and W.\\nmissed him very much. He was very intelligent, a keen observer, had\\nbeen all over the world, and his knowledge and appreciation of foreign\\ncountries and ways was often very useful to W.\\n\\nWe continued our dinners and receptions, which always interested me, we\\nsaw so many people of all kinds. One dinner was for Prince Alexander of\\nBattenberg, just as he was starting to take possession of the new\\nprincipality of Bulgaria. He was one of the handsomest men I have ever\\nseen,--tall, young, strong. He seemed the type of the dashing young\\nchief who would inspire confidence in a new independent state. He didn\\'t\\nspeak of his future with much enthusiasm. I wonder if a presentiment was\\neven then overclouding what seemed a brilliant beginning! He talked a\\ngreat deal at dinner. He was just back from Rome, and full of its charm,\\nwhich at once made a bond of sympathy between us. Report said he had\\nleft his heart there with a young Roman. He certainly spoke of the happy\\ndays with a shade of melancholy. I suggested that he ought to marry,\\nthat would make his \"exile,\" as he called it, easier to bear. \"Ah, yes,\\nif one could choose.\" Then after a pause, with an almost boyish\\npetulance: \"They want me to marry Princess X., but I don\\'t want to.\" \"Is\\nshe pretty, will she help you in your new country?\" \"I don\\'t know; I\\ndon\\'t care; I have never seen her.\"\\n\\nPoor fellow, he had a wretched experience. Some of the \"exiles\" were\\nless interesting. A lady asked to see me one day, to enlist my\\nsympathies for her brother and plead his cause with the minister. He had\\nbeen named to a post which he couldn\\'t really accept. I rather demurred,\\ntelling her messenger, one of the secretaries of the Foreign Office,\\nthat it was quite useless, her asking me to interfere. W. was not very\\nlikely to consult me in his choice of nominations--and in fact the small\\nappointments, secretaries, were generally prepared in the Chancellerie\\nand followed the usual routine of regular promotion. An ambassador, of\\ncourse, was different, and was sometimes taken quite outside the\\ncarriere. The lady persisted and appeared one morning--a pretty,\\nwell-dressed femme du monde whom I had often met without making her\\nacquaintance. She plunged at once into her subject--her brother\\'s\\ndelicate health, accustomed to all the comforts and what the books call\\n\"higher civilisation\" of Europe, able to do good service in courts and\\nsociety, as he knew everybody. It was a pity to send him to such an\\nout-of-the-way place, with an awful climate,--any consul\\'s clerk would\\ndo as well. I supposed he had been named to Caracas, South America, or\\nsome other remote and unhealthy part of the globe, but when she stopped\\nfor a moment, I discovered that the young man was named to Washington. I\\nwas really surprised, didn\\'t know what to say at once, when the\\nabsurdity of the thing struck me and I answered that Washington was far,\\nperhaps across the ocean, but there were compensations--but she took up\\nher argument again, such an impossible place, everything so primitive, I\\nreally think she thought the youth was going to an Indian settlement,\\nall squaws and wigwams and tomahawks. I declined any interference with\\nthe minister\\'s appointments, assuring her I had no influence whatever,\\nand she took leave of me very icily. I heard the sequel afterward--the\\nyoung man refused the post as quite unworthy of him. There were several\\nothers ready and pleased to take it, and M. de X. was put en\\ndisponibilite.\\n\\nWe saw too that year for the first time the Grand Duke Alexander of\\nRussia (later Emperor Alexander III, whose coronation we went to at\\nMoscow) and the Grande Duchesse Marie. Prince Orloff arranged the\\ninterview, as he was very anxious that the Grand Duke should have some\\ntalk with W. They were in Paris for three or four days, staying at the\\nHotel Bristol, where they received us. He was a tall, handsome man,\\nwith a blond beard and blue eyes, quite the Northern type. She recalled\\nher sister (Queen Alexandra), not quite so tall, but with the same\\ngracious manner and beautiful eyes. The Grand Duke talked a great deal,\\nprincipally politics, to W. He expressed himself very doubtfully about\\nthe stability of the Republic, and was evidently worried over the\\npossibility of a general amnesty, \"a very dangerous measure which no\\ngovernment should sanction.\" W. assured him there would be no general\\namnesty, but he seemed sceptical, repeated several times: \"Soyez stable,\\nsoyez ferme.\" The Grande Duchesse talked to me about Paris, the streets\\nwere so gay, the shops so tempting, and all the people so smiling and\\nhappy. I suppose the contrast struck her, coming from Russia where the\\npeople look sad and listless. I was much impressed with their sad,\\nrepressed look when we were in Russia for the coronation--one never\\nheard people laugh or sing in the streets--and yet we were there at a\\ntime of great national rejoicings, amusements of all kinds provided for\\nthe people. Their national melodies, volklieder (songs of the people),\\nhave always a strain of sadness running through them. Our conversation\\nwas in French, which both spoke very well.\\n\\nThe winter months went by quickly enough with periodical alarms in the\\npolitical world when some new measure was discussed which aroused\\neverybody\\'s passions and satisfied neither side. I made weekly visits to\\nmy own house, which was never dismantled, as I always felt our stay at\\nthe Quai d\\'Orsay would not last much longer. One of our colleagues,\\nMadame Leon Say, an intelligent, charming woman, took matters more\\nphilosophically than I did. Her husband had been in and out of office so\\noften that she was quite indifferent to sudden changes of residence.\\nThey too kept their house open and she said she had always a terrine de\\ncrise ready in her larders.\\n\\nThe diplomatic appointments, the embassies particularly, were a\\ndifficulty. Admiral Pothnau went to London. He was a very gallant\\nofficer and had served with the English in the Crimea--had the order of\\nthe Bath, and exactly that stand-off, pompous manner which suits English\\npeople. General Chanzy went to St. Petersburg. It has been the tradition\\nalmost always to send a soldier to Russia. There is so little\\nintercourse between the Russian Emperor and any foreigner, even an\\nambassador, that an ordinary diplomatist, no matter how intelligent or\\nexperienced he might be, would have very few opportunities to talk to\\nthe Emperor; whereas an officer, with the various reviews and\\nmanoeuvres that are always going on in Russia, would surely approach him\\nmore easily. I was so struck when we were in Russia with the immense\\ndistance that separated the princes from the ordinary mortals. They seem\\nlike demigods on a different plane (in Russia I mean; of course when\\nthey come to Paris their godlike attributes disappear, unfortunately for\\nthemselves).\\n\\nChanzy was very happy in Russia, where he was extremely well received.\\nHe dined with us one night, when he was at home on leave, and was most\\nenthusiastic about everything in Russia--their finances, their army--the\\nwomen of all classes so intelligent, so patriotic. He was evidently\\nquite sous le charme. When he had gone, M. Desprey, then Directeur de la\\nPolitique, a very clever man, who had seen many ambassadors come and go\\nfrom all the capitals of Europe, said:\\n\\n\"It is curious how all the ambassadors who go to Russia have that same\\nimpression. I have never known it to fail. It is the Russian policy to\\nbe delightful to the ambassadors--make life very easy for them--show\\nthem all that is brilliant and interesting--open all doors (society,\\netc.) and keep all sordid and ugly questions in the background.\"\\n\\nSt. Vallier remained at Berlin. His name had been mentioned for Foreign\\nMinister when Dufaure was making his cabinet, but he hadn\\'t the health\\nfor it--and I think preferred being in Berlin. He knew Germany well and\\nhad a good many friends in Berlin.\\n\\nW. of course had a great many men\\'s dinners, from which I was excluded.\\nI dined often with some of my friends, not of the official world, and I\\nused to ask myself sometimes if the Quai d\\'Orsay and these houses could\\nbe in the same country. It was an entirely different world, every point\\nof view different, not only politics--that one would expect, as the\\nwhole of society was anti-Republican, Royalist, or Bonapartist--but\\nevery question discussed wore a different aspect. Once or twice there\\nwas a question of Louis XIV and what he would have done in certain\\ncases,--the religious question always a passionate one. That of course I\\nnever discussed, being a Protestant, and knowing quite well that the\\nreal fervent Catholics think Protestants have no religion.\\n\\nI was out driving with a friend one morning in Lent (Holy Week),\\nThursday I think--and said I could not be out late, as I must go to\\nchurch--perhaps she would drop me at the Protestant Chapel in the Avenue\\nde la Grand Armee. She was so absolutely astonished that it was almost\\nfunny, though I was half angry too. \"You are going to church on Holy\\nThursday. I didn\\'t know Protestants ever kept Lent, or Holy Week or any\\nsaint\\'s day.\" \"Don\\'t you think we ever go to church?\" \"Oh, yes, to a\\nconference or sermon on Sundays, but you are not pratiquant like us.\" I\\nwas really put out, and tried another day, when she was sitting with me,\\nto show her our prayerbook, and explained that the Creed and the Lord\\'s\\nPrayer, to say nothing of various other prayers, were just the same as\\nin her livre de Messe, but I didn\\'t make any impression upon her--her\\nonly remark being, \"I suppose you do believe in God,\"--yet she was a\\nclever, well-educated woman--knew her French history well, and must have\\nknown what a part the French Protestants played at one time in France,\\nwhen many of the great nobles were Protestants.\\n\\nYears afterward, with the same friend, we were discussing the proposed\\nmarriage of the Duke of Clarence, eldest son of the late King Edward VII\\nof England, who wanted very much to marry Princess Helene d\\'Orleans,\\ndaughter of the Comte de Paris, now Duchesse d\\'Aosta. It was impossible\\nfor the English prince, heir to the throne, to marry a Catholic\\nprincess--it seemed equally impossible for the French princess to become\\na Protestant. The Pope was consulted and very strong influence brought\\nto bear on the question, but the Catholic Church was firm. We were in\\nLondon at the time, and of course heard the question much discussed. It\\nwas an interesting case, as the two young people were much in love with\\neach other. I said to my friend:\\n\\n\"If I were in the place of the Princess Helene I should make myself a\\nProtestant. It is a big bait for the daughter of an exiled prince to be\\nQueen of England.\"\\n\\n\"But it couldn\\'t be; no Catholic could change her religion or make\\nherself Protestant.\"\\n\\n\"Yet there is a precedent in your history. Your King Henri IV of beloved\\nmemory, a Protestant, didn\\'t hesitate to make himself a Catholic to be\\nKing of France.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but that is quite different.\"\\n\\n\"For you perhaps, chere amie, but not for us.\"\\n\\nHowever, the poor young prince died suddenly of pneumonia, so the\\nsacrifice would have been in vain.\\n\\nAll the autumn of \\'79 was very agitated. We were obliged to curtail our\\nstay at Bourneville, our country home. Even though the Chambers were not\\nsitting, every description of political intrigue was going on. Every day\\nW. had an immense courrier and every second day a secretary came down\\nfrom the Quai d\\'Orsay with despatches and papers to sign. Telegrams came\\nall day long. W. had one or two shooting breakfasts and the long tramps\\nin the woods rested him. The guests were generally the notabilities of\\nthe small towns and villages of his circumscription,--mayors, farmers,\\nand small landowners. They all talked politics and W. was surprised to\\nsee how in this quiet agricultural district the fever of democracy had\\nmounted. Usually the well-to-do farmer is very conservative, looks\\naskance at the very advanced opinions of the young radicals, but a\\ncomplete change had come over them. They seemed to think the Republic,\\nfounded at last upon a solid basis, supported by honest Republicans,\\nwould bring untold prosperity not only to the country, but to each\\nindividual, and many very modest, unpretending citizens of the small\\ntowns saw themselves conseilleurs generaux, deputies, perhaps even\\nministers. It was a curious change. However, on the whole, the people in\\nour part of the world were reasonable. I was sorry to go back to town. I\\nliked the last beautiful days of September in the country. The trees\\nwere just beginning to turn, and the rides in the woods were delightful,\\nthe roads so soft and springy. The horses seemed to like the brisk\\ncanter as much as we did. We disturbed all the forest life as we\\ngalloped along--hares and rabbits scuttled away--we saw their white\\ntails disappearing into holes, and when we crossed a bit of plain,\\npartridges a long distance off would rise and take their crooked flight\\nacross the fields. It was so still, always is in the woods, that the\\nhorses\\' feet could be heard a long way off. It was getting colder (all\\nthe country folk predicted a very cold winter) and the wood-fire looked\\nvery cheerful and comfortable in my little salon when we came in.\\n\\nHowever, everything must end, and W. had to go back to the fight, which\\npromised to be lively. In Paris we found people wearing furs and\\npreparing for a cold winter. The house of the Quai d\\'Orsay was\\ncomfortable, well warmed, caloriferes and big fires in all the rooms,\\nand whenever there was any sun it poured into the rooms from the garden.\\nI didn\\'t take up my official afternoon receptions. The session had not\\nbegun, and, as it seemed extremely unlikely that the coming year would\\nsee us still at the Quai d\\'Orsay, it was not worth while to embark upon\\nthat dreary function. I was at home every afternoon after five--had tea\\nin my little blue salon, and always had two or three people to keep me\\ncompany. Prince Hohenlohe came often, settled himself in an armchair\\nwith his cup of tea, and talked easily and charmingly about everything.\\nHe was just back from Germany and reported Bismarck and the Emperor (I\\nshould have said, perhaps, the Emperor and Bismarck) as rather worried\\nover the rapid strides France was making in radicalism. He reassured\\nthem, told them Grevy was essentially a man of peace, and, as long as\\nmoderate men like W., Leon Say, and their friends remained in office,\\nthings would go quietly. \"Yes, if they remain. I have an idea we shan\\'t\\nstay much longer, and report says Freycinet will be the next premier.\"\\nHe evidently had heard the same report, and spoke warmly of\\nFreycinet,--intelligent, energetic, and such a precise mind. If W. were\\nobliged to resign, which he personally would regret, he thought\\nFreycinet was the coming man--unless Gambetta wanted to be premier. He\\ndidn\\'t think he did, was not quite ready yet, but his hand might be\\nforced by his friends, and of course if he wanted it, he would be the\\nnext President du Conseil. He also told me a great many things that\\nBlowitz had said to him--he had a great opinion of him--said he was so\\nmarvellously well-informed of all that was going on. It was curious to\\nsee how a keen, clever man like Prince Hohenlohe attached so much\\nimportance to anything that Blowitz said. The nuncio, Monseigneur\\nCzaski, came too sometimes at tea-time. He was a charming talker, but I\\nalways felt as if he were saying exactly what he meant to and what he\\nwanted me to repeat to W. I am never quite sure with Italians. There is\\nalways a certain reticence under their extremely natural, rather\\nexuberant manner. Monseigneur Czaski was not an Italian by birth--a\\nPole, but I don\\'t know that they inspire much more confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nPARLIAMENT BACK IN PARIS\\n\\nThe question of the return of the Parliament to Paris had at last been\\nsolved after endless discussions. All the Republicans were in favour of\\nit, and they were masters of the situation. The President, Grevy, too\\nwanted it very much. If the Chambers continued to sit at Versailles, he\\nwould be obliged to establish himself there, which he didn\\'t want to do.\\nMany people were very unwilling to make the change, were honestly\\nnervous about possible disturbances in the streets, and, though they\\ngrumbled too at the loss of time, the draughty carriages of the\\nparliamentary train, etc., they still preferred those discomforts to any\\npossibility of rioting and street fights, and the invasion of the\\nChamber of Deputies by a Paris mob. W. was very anxious for the change.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t in the least anticipate any trouble--his principal reason for\\nwanting the Parliament back was the loss of time, and also to get rid of\\nthe conversations in the train, which tired him very much. He never\\ncould make himself heard without an effort, as his voice was low, had no\\n\"timbre,\" and he didn\\'t hear his neighbours very well in the noise of\\nthe train. He always arrived at the station at the last minute, and got\\ninto the last carriage, hoping to be undisturbed, and have a quiet\\nhalf-hour with his papers, but he was rarely left alone. If any deputy\\nwho wanted anything recognised him, he of course got in the same\\ncarriage, because he knew he was sure of a half-hour to state his case,\\nas the minister couldn\\'t get away from him. The Chambers met, after a\\nshort vacation in November, at last in Paris, and already there were so\\nmany interpellations announced on every possible subject, so many\\ncriticisms on the policy of the cabinet, and so many people wanting\\nother people\\'s places, that the session promised to be very lively--the\\nSenate at the Palais du Luxembourg, the Deputies at the Palais Bourbon.\\n\\nW. and I went over to the Luxembourg one morning early in October, to\\nsee the arrangements that had been made for the Senate. He wanted too to\\nchoose his seat. I hadn\\'t been there in the daytime for years--I had\\ndined once or twice at the Petit Palais with various presidents of the\\nSenate, but my only impression was a very long drive (from the Barriere\\nde l\\'Etoile where we lived) and fine high rooms with heavy gilt\\nfurniture and tapestries. The palace was built by Maria de\\' Medici, wife\\nof Henri IV. After the death of that very chivalrous but very undomestic\\nmonarch, she retired to the Luxembourg, and from there as regent (her\\nson Louis XIII was only ten years old when his father died) for some\\nyears directed the policy of France under the guidance of her favourite,\\nthe Italian Concini, and his wife.\\n\\nThe palace recalls very much the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, with its\\nsolid masonry and rather severe heavy architecture. It must have been a\\ngloomy residence, notwithstanding the beautiful gardens with their broad\\nalleys and great open spaces. The gardens are stiff, very Italian, with\\nstatues, fountains, and marble balustrades--not many flowers, except\\nimmediately around the palace, but they were flooded with sunshine that\\nday, and the old grey pile seemed to rise out of a parterre of bright\\nflowers. The palace has been slightly modernised, but the general\\narchitecture remains the same. Many people of all kinds have lived there\\nsince it was built--several royal princes, and the Emperor Napoleon when\\nhe was First Consul. He went from there to the Tuileries. The Luxembourg\\nPalace has always been associated with the history of France. During\\nthe Revolution it was a prison, and many of the curious scenes one reads\\nof at that period took place in those old walls--the grandes dames so\\ncareful of their dress and their manners, the grands seigneurs so brave\\nand gallant, striving in every way by their witty conversation and their\\nmusic (for they sang and played in the prisons all through that awful\\ntime) to distract the women and make them forget the terrible doom that\\nwas hanging over them. Many well-known people went straight from the\\npalace to the scaffold. It seemed a fitting place for the sittings of\\nthe Senate and the deliberations of a chosen body of men, who were\\nsupposed to bring a maturer judgment and a wider experience in the\\ndiscussion of all the burning questions of the day than the ardent young\\ndeputies so eager to have done with everything connected with the old\\nregime and start fresh.\\n\\nAfter we had inspected the palace we walked about the gardens, which\\nwere charming that bright October morning,--the sun really too strong.\\nWe found a bench in the shade, and sat there very happy, W. smoking and\\nwondering what the next turn of the wheel would bring us. A great many\\npeople were walking about and sitting under the trees. It was quite a\\ndifferent public from what one saw anywhere else, many students of both\\nsexes carrying books, small easels, and campstools,--some of the men\\nsuch evident Bohemians, with long hair, sweeping moustache, and soft\\nfelt hat,--quite the type one sees in the pictures or plays of \"La Vie\\nde Boheme.\" Their girl companions looked very trim and neat, dressed\\ngenerally in black, their clothes fitting extremely well--most of them\\nbareheaded, but some had hats of the simplest description--none of the\\nflaunting feathers and bright flowers one sees on the boulevards. They\\nare a type apart, the modern grisettes, so quiet and well-behaved as to\\nbe almost respectable. One always hears that the Quartier Latin doesn\\'t\\nexist any more--the students are more serious, less turbulent, and that\\nthe hardworking little grisette, quite content with her simple life and\\npleasure, has degenerated into the danseuse of the music-halls and\\nbarriere theatres. I don\\'t think so. A certain class of young,\\nimpecunious students will always live in that quarter and will always\\namuse themselves, and they will also always find girls quite ready and\\nhappy to enjoy life a little while they are young enough to live in the\\npresent, and have no cares for the future. Children were playing about\\nin the alleys and broad, open spaces, and climbing on the fountains\\nwhen the keepers of the garden were not anywhere near--their nurses\\nsitting in a sunny corner with their work. It was quite another world,\\nneither the Champs-Elysees nor Montmartre. All looked perfectly\\nrespectable, and the couples sitting on out-of-the-way benches, in most\\naffectionate attitudes, were too much taken up with each other to heed\\nthe passer-by.\\n\\nI went back there several times afterward, taking Francis with me, and\\nit was curious how out of the world one felt. Paris, our Paris, might\\nhave been miles away. I learned to know some of the habitues quite\\nwell--a white-haired old gentleman who always brought bread for the\\nbirds; they knew him perfectly and would flutter down to the Square as\\nsoon as he appeared--a handsome young man with a tragic face, always\\nalone, walking up and down muttering and talking to himself--he may have\\nbeen an aspirant for the Odeon or some of the theatres in the\\nneighbourhood--a lame man on crutches, a child walking beside him\\nlooking wistfully at the children playing about but not daring to leave\\nher charge--groups of students hurrying through the gardens on their way\\nto the Sorbonne, their black leather serviettes under their\\narms--couples always everywhere. I don\\'t think there were many\\nforeigners or tourists,--I never heard anything but French spoken. Even\\nthe most disreputable-looking old beggar at the gate who sold\\nshoe-laces, learned to know us, and would run to open the door of\\nthe carriage.\\n\\nWith the contrariety of human nature, some people would say of feminine\\nnature, now that I felt I was not going to live much longer on the rive\\ngauche I was getting quite fond of it. Life was so quiet and restful in\\nthose long, narrow streets, some even with grass growing on the\\npavement--no trams, no omnibuses, very little passing, glimpses\\noccasionally of big houses standing well back from the street, a\\ngood-sized courtyard in front and garden at the back--the classic\\nFaubourg St. Germain hotel entre cour et jardin. I went to tea sometimes\\nwith a friend who lived in a big, old-fashioned house in the rue de\\nVarenne. She lived on the fourth floor--one went up a broad, bare, cold\\nstone staircase (which always reminded me of some of the staircases in\\nthe Roman palaces). Her rooms were large, very high ceilings, very\\nlittle furniture in them, very little fire in winter, fine old family\\nportraits on the walls, but from the windows one looked down on a lovely\\ngarden where the sun shone and the birds sang all day. It was just like\\nbeing in the country, so extraordinarily quiet. A very respectable man\\nservant in an old-fashioned brown livery, with a great many brass\\nbuttons, who looked as old as the house itself and as if he were part of\\nit, always opened the door. Her husband was a literary man who made\\nconferences at the Sorbonne and the College de France, and they lived\\nentirely in that quarter--came very rarely to our part of Paris. He was\\nan old friend of W.\\'s, and they came sometimes to dine with us. He\\ndeplored W.\\'s having gone to the Foreign Office--thought the Public\\nInstruction was so much more to his tastes and habits. She had an\\nEnglish grandmother, knew English quite well, and read English reviews\\nand papers. She had once seen Queen Victoria and was very interested in\\nall that concerned her. Queen Victoria had a great prestige in France.\\nPeople admired not only the wise sovereign who had weathered\\nsuccessfully so many changes, but the beautiful woman\\'s life as wife and\\nmother. She was always spoken of with the greatest respect, even by\\npeople who were not sympathetic to England as a nation.\\n\\nAnother of my haunts was the Convent and Maison de Sante of the Soeurs\\nAugustines du Saint Coeur de Marie in the rue de la Sante. It was\\ncurious to turn out of the broad, busy, populous avenue, crowded with\\ntrams, omnibuses, and camions, into the narrow, quiet street, which\\nseemed all stone walls and big doors. There was another hospital and a\\nprison in the street, which naturally gave it rather a gloomy aspect,\\nbut once inside the courtyard of the Convent there was a complete\\ntransformation. One found one\\'s self in a large, square, open court with\\narcades and buildings all around--the chapel just opposite the entrance.\\nOn one side of the court were the rooms for the patients, on the other\\nnice rooms and small apartments which were let to invalids or old\\nladies, and which opened on a garden, really a park of thirteen or\\nfourteen acres. The doors were always open, and one had a lovely view of\\ngreen fields and trees. The moment you put your foot inside the court,\\nyou felt the atmosphere of peace and cheerfulness, though it was a\\nhospital. The nuns all looked happy and smiling--they always do, and I\\nalways wonder why. Life in a cloister seems to me so narrow and\\nmonotonous and unsatisfying unless one has been bred in a convent and\\nknows nothing of life but what the teachers tell.\\n\\nI have a friend who always fills me with astonishment--a very clever,\\ncultivated woman, no longer very young, married to a charming man,\\naccustomed to life in its largest sense. She was utterly wretched when\\nher husband died, but after a time she took up her life again and\\nseemed to find interest and pleasure in the things they had done\\ntogether. Suddenly she announced her intention of becoming a nun--sold\\nher house and lovely garden, where she had spent so many happy hours\\nwith her flowers and her birds, distributed her pretty things among her\\nfriends, and accepted all the small trials of strict convent life--no\\nbath, nor mirror, coarse underlinen and sheets--no fire, no lights, no\\nprivacy, the regular irksome routine of a nun\\'s life, and is perfectly\\nhappy--never misses the intellectual companionship and the refinement\\nand daintiness of her former life,--likes the commonplace routine of the\\nconvent--the books they read to each other in \"recreation,\" simple\\nstories one would hardly give to a child of twelve or fourteen,--the\\nfetes on the \"mother\\'s\" birthday, when the nuns make a cake and put a\\nwreath of roses on the mother\\'s head.\\n\\nThe Soeurs Augustines are very happy in their lives, but they see a\\ngreat deal more of the outside world. They always have patients in the\\nhospital, and people in the apartments, which are much in demand. The\\ncare and attendance is very good. The ladies are very comfortable and\\nhave as many visitors as they like in the afternoon at stated hours, and\\nthe rooms are very tempting with white walls and furniture, and\\nscrupulously clean. The cuisine is very good, everything very daintily\\nserved. All day one saw black-robed figures moving quietly across the\\ncourt, carrying all kinds of invalid paraphernalia--cushions, rugs, cups\\nof bouillon--but there was never any noise--no sound of talking or\\nlaughing. When they spoke, the voices were low, like people accustomed\\nto a sick-room. No men were allowed in the Convent, except the doctors\\nof course, and visitors at stated hours.\\n\\nI spent many days there one spring, as C. was there for some weeks for a\\nslight operation. She had a charming room and dressing-room, with\\nwindows giving on a garden or rather farmyard, for the soeurs had their\\ncows and chickens. Sometimes in the evening we would see one of the\\nsisters, her black skirt tucked up and a blue apron over it, bringing\\nthe cows back to their stables. No man could have a room in the house.\\nF. wanted very much to be with his wife at night, as he was a busy man\\nand away all day, and I tried to get a room for him, but the mother\\nsuperior, a delightful old lady, wouldn\\'t hear of it. However, the night\\nbefore-and the night after the operation, he was allowed to remain with\\nher,--no extra bed was put in the room--he slept on the sofa.\\n\\nOften when C. was sleeping or tired, I would take my book and establish\\nmyself in the garden. Paris might have been miles away, though only a\\nfew yards off there was a busy, crowded boulevard, but no noise seemed\\nto penetrate the thick walls. Occasionally at the end of a quiet path I\\nwould see a black figure pacing backward and forward, with eyes fixed on\\na breviary. Once or twice a soeur jardiniere with a big, flat straw hat\\nover her coiffe and veil tending the flowers (there were not many) or\\nweeding the lawn, sometimes convalescents or old ladies seated in\\narmchairs under the trees, but there was never any sound of voices or of\\nlife. It was very reposeful (when one felt one could get away for a\\nlittle while), but I think the absolute calm and monotony would pall\\nupon one, and the \"Call of the World\"--the struggling, living, joyous\\nworld outside the walls--would be an irresistible temptation.\\n\\nI walked about a good deal in my quarter in the morning, and made\\nacquaintance with many funny little old squares and shops, merceries,\\nflower and toy shops which had not yet been swallowed up by the enormous\\nestablishments like the Louvre, the Bon Marche, and the big bazaars. I\\ndon\\'t know how they existed; there was never any one in the shops, and\\nof course their choice was limited, but they were so grateful, their\\nthings were so much cheaper, and they were so anxious to get anything\\none wanted, that it was a pleasure to deal with them. Everything was\\nmuch cheaper on that side--flowers, cakes, writing-paper, rents,\\nservants\\' wages, stable equipment, horses\\' food. We bought some toys one\\nyear for one of our Christmas trees in the country from a poor old lame\\nwoman who had a tiny shop in one of the small streets running out of the\\nrue du Bac. Her grandson, a boy of about twelve or fourteen, helped her\\nin the shop, and they were so pleased and excited at having such a large\\norder that they were quite bewildered. We did get what we wanted, but it\\ntook time and patience,--their stock was small and not varied. We had to\\nchoose piece by piece--horses, dolls, drums, etc.--and the writing down\\nof the items and making up the additions was long and trying. I meant to\\ngo back after we left the Quai d\\'Orsay, but I never did, and I am afraid\\nthe poor old woman with her petit commerce shared the fate of all the\\nothers and could not hold out against the big shops.\\n\\nOne gets lazy about shopping. The first years we lived in the country we\\nused to go ourselves to the big shops and bazaars in Paris for our\\nChristmas shopping, but the heat and the crowd and the waiting were so\\ntiring that we finally made arrangements with the woman who sold toys in\\nthe little town, La Ferte-Milon. She went to Paris and brought back\\nspecimens of all the new toys. We went into town one afternoon--all the\\ntoys were spread out on tables in her little parlour at the back of the\\nshop (her little girl attending to the customers, who were consumed with\\ncuriosity as to why our carriage was waiting so long at the door) and we\\nmade our selection. She was a great help to us, as she knew all the\\nchildren, their ages, and what they would like. She was very pleased to\\nexecute the commission--it made her of importance in the town, having\\nthe big boxes come down from Paris addressed to her, and she paid her\\njourney and made a very good profit by charging two or three sous more\\non each article. We were quite willing to pay the few extra francs to be\\nsaved the fatigue of the long day\\'s shopping in Paris. It also settled\\nanother difficult question--what to buy in a small country town. Once we\\nhad exhausted the butcher and the baker and the small groceries, there\\nwas not much to buy.\\n\\nFrom the beginning of my life in the country, W. always wanted me to buy\\nas much as possible in the town, and I was often puzzled. Now the shops\\nin all the small country towns have improved. They have their things\\nstraight from Paris, with very good catalogues, so that one can order\\nfairly well. The things are more expensive of course, but I think it is\\nright to give what help one can to the people of the country. One cold\\nwinter at Bourneville, when we had our house full of people, there was a\\nsudden call for blankets. I thought my \"lingerie\" was pretty well\\nstocked, but one gentleman wanted four blankets on his bed, three over\\nhim and one under the sheet. A couple wanted the same, only one more, a\\nblanket for a big armchair near the fire. I went in to La Ferte to see\\nwhat I could find--no white blankets anywhere--some rather nice red\\nones--and plenty of the stiff (not at all warm) grey blankets they give\\nto the soldiers. Those naturally were out of the question, but I took\\nthree or four red ones, which of course could not go in the guests\\'\\nrooms, but were distributed on the beds of the family, their white ones\\ngoing to the friends. After that experience I always had a reserve of\\nblankets, but I was never asked for so many again. Living in the\\ncountry, with people constantly staying in the house, gives one much\\ninsight into other people\\'s way of living and what are the necessities\\nof life for them. I thought our house was pretty well provided for. We\\nwere a large family party, and had all we wanted, but some of the\\ndemands were curious, varying of course with the nationalities.\\n\\nThe Chambers met in Paris at the end of November and took possession of\\ntheir respective houses without the slightest disturbance of any kind.\\nUp to the last moment some people were nervous and predicting all sorts\\nof trouble and complications. We spent the Toussaint in the country with\\nsome friends, and their views of the future were so gloomy that it was\\nalmost contagious. One afternoon when we were all assembled in the\\ndrawing-room for tea, after a beautiful day\\'s shooting, the conversation\\n(generally retrospective) was so melancholy that I was rather impressed\\nby it,--\"The beginning of the end,--the culpable weakness of the\\nGovernment and Moderate men, giving way entirely to the Radicals, an\\ninvitation to the Paris rabble to interfere with the sittings of the\\nChambers,\" and a variety of similar remarks.\\n\\nIt would have been funny if one hadn\\'t felt that the speakers were\\nreally in earnest and anxious. However, nothing happened. The first few\\ndays there was a small, perfectly quiet, well-behaved crowd, also a very\\nstrong police force, at the Palais Bourbon, but I think more from\\ncuriosity and the novelty of seeing deputies again at the Palais Bourbon\\nthan from any other reason. If it were quiet outside, one couldn\\'t say\\nthe same of the inside of the Chamber. The fight began hotly at once.\\nSpeeches and interpellations and attacks on the Government were the\\norder of the day. The different members of the cabinet made statements\\nexplaining their policy, but apparently they had satisfied nobody on\\neither side, and it was evident that the Chamber was not only\\ndissatisfied but actively hostile.\\n\\nW. and his friends were very discouraged and disgusted. They had gone as\\nfar as they could in the way of concessions. W., at any rate, would do\\nno more, and it was evident that the Chamber would seize the first\\npretext to overthrow the ministry. W. saw Grevy very often. He was\\nopposed to any change, didn\\'t want W. to go, said his presence at the\\nForeign Office gave confidence to Europe,--he might perhaps remain at\\nthe Foreign Office and resign as Premier, but that, naturally, he\\nwouldn\\'t do. He was really sick of the whole thing.\\n\\nGrevy was a thorough Republican but an old-fashioned Republican,--not in\\nthe least enthusiastic, rather sceptical--didn\\'t at all see the ideal\\nRepublic dreamed of by the younger men--where all men were alike--and\\nnothing but honesty and true patriotism were the ruling motives. I\\ndon\\'t know if he went as far as a well-known diplomatist, Prince\\nMetternich, I think, who said he was so tired of the word fraternite\\nthat if he had a brother he would call him \"cousin.\" Grevy was certainly\\nvery unwilling to see things pass into the hands of the more advanced\\nLeft. I don\\'t think he could have done anything--they say no\\nconstitutional President (or King either) can.\\n\\nThere was a great rivalry between him and Gambetta. Both men had such a\\nstrong position in the Republican party that it was a pity they couldn\\'t\\nunderstand each other. I suppose they were too unlike--Gambetta lived in\\nan atmosphere of flattery and adulation. His head might well have been\\nturned--all his familiars were at his feet, hanging upon his words,\\nputting him on a pinnacle as a splendid patriot. Grevy\\'s entourage was\\nmuch calmer, recognising his great ability and his keen legal mind, not\\nso enthusiastic but always wanting to have his opinion, and relying a\\ngood deal upon his judgment. There were of course all sorts of meetings\\nand conversations at our house, with Leon Say, Jules Ferry, Casimir\\nPerier, and others. St. Vallier came on from Berlin, where he was still\\nambassador. He was very anxious about the state of affairs in\\nFrance--said Bismarck was very worried at the great step the Radicals\\nhad made in the new Parliament--was afraid the Moderate men would have\\nno show. _I_ believe he was pleased and hoped that a succession of\\nincapable ministries and internal quarrels would weaken France still\\nmore--and prevent her from taking her place again as a great power. He\\nwasn\\'t a generous victor.\\n\\nAs long as W. was at the Foreign Office things went very smoothly. He\\nand St. Vallier thought alike on most subjects, home politics and\\nforeign--and since the Berlin Congress, where W. had come in touch with\\nall the principal men in Germany, it was of course much easier for them\\nto work together. We dined generally with my mother on Sunday\\nnight--particularly at this time of the year, when the official banquets\\nhad not begun and our Sundays were free. The evenings were always\\ninteresting, as we saw so many people, English and Americans always, and\\nin fact all nationalities. We had lived abroad so much that we knew\\npeople all over the world,--it was a change from the eternal politics\\nand \"shop\" talk we heard everywhere else. Some of them, English\\nparticularly (I don\\'t think the Americans cared much about foreign\\npolitics), were most interested and curious over what was going on, and\\nthe probable fall of the cabinet. An English lady said to me: \"How\\ndreadful it will be for you when your husband is no longer minister;\\nyour life will be so dull and you will be of so much less importance.\"\\nThe last part of the sentence was undoubtedly true--any functionary\\'s\\nwife has a certain importance in France, and when your husband has been\\nForeign Minister and Premier, you fall from a certain height, but I\\ncouldn\\'t accept the first part, that my life would be necessarily dull\\nbecause I was no longer what one of my friends said in Italy, speaking\\nof a minister\\'s wife, a donna publica. I began to explain that I really\\nhad some interest in life outside of politics, but she was so convinced\\nof the truth of her observation that it was quite useless to pursue the\\nconversation, and I naturally didn\\'t care. Another one, an American this\\ntime, said to me: \"I hope you don\\'t mind my never having been to see you\\nsince you were married, but I never could remember your name; I only\\nknew it began with W. and one sees it very often in the papers.\"\\n\\nArthur Sullivan, the English composer, was there one night. He had come\\nover to Paris to hear one of his symphonies played at the Conservatoire,\\nand was very much pleased with the way it had been received by that very\\ncritical audience. He was quite surprised to find the Parisians so\\nenthusiastic--had always heard the Paris Salle was so cold.\\n\\nMiss Kellogg, the American prima donna, was there too that evening, and\\nwe made a great deal of music, she singing and Sullivan accompanying by\\nheart. Mrs. Freeman, wife of one of the English secretaries, told W.\\nthat Queen Victoria had so enjoyed her talk with him--\"quite as if I\\nwere talking with one of my own ministers.\" She had found Grevy rather\\nstiff and reserved--said their conversation was absolutely banal. They\\nspoke in French, and as Grevy knew nothing of England or the English,\\nthe interview couldn\\'t have been interesting.\\n\\nWe saw a great many people that last month, dined with all our\\ncolleagues of the diplomatic corps. They were already diners d\\'adieux,\\nas every day in the papers the fall of the ministry was announced, and\\nthe names of the new ministers published. I think the diplomatists were\\nsorry to see W. go, but of course they couldn\\'t feel very strongly on\\nthe subject. Their business is to be on good terms with all the foreign\\nministers, and to get as much as they can out of them. They are, with\\nrare exceptions, birds of passage, and don\\'t trouble themselves much\\nabout changing cabinets. However, they were all very civil, not too\\ndiffuse, and one had the impression that they would be just as civil to\\nour successor and to his successor. It must be so; there is no\\nprofession so absolutely banal as diplomacy. All diplomatists, from the\\nambassador to the youngest secretary, must follow their instructions,\\nand if by any chance an ambassador does take any initiative, profiting\\nby being on the spot, and knowing the character of the people, he is\\npromptly disowned by his chief.\\n\\nI had grown very philosophical, was quite ready to go or to stay, didn\\'t\\nmind the fight any more nor the attacks on W., which were not very\\nvicious, but so absurd that no one who knew him could attach the least\\nimportance to them. He didn\\'t care a pin. He had always been a\\nProtestant, with an English name, educated in England, so the\\nreiteration of these facts, very much exaggerated and leading up to the\\nconclusion that on account of his birth and education he couldn\\'t be a\\nconvinced French Republican, didn\\'t affect him very much. He had always\\npromised me a winter in Italy when he left office. He had never been in\\nRome, and I was delighted at the prospect of seeing that lovely land\\nagain, all blue sky and bright sun and smiling faces.\\n\\nWe dined often with M.L., W.\\'s uncle, who kept us au courant of all (and\\nit was little) that was going on in the Royalist camp, but that was not\\nof importance. The advanced Republicans were having it all their own\\nway, and it was evident that the days of conciliatory measures and\\nmoderate men were over. W. was not a club man, went very rarely to his\\nclub, but his uncle went every afternoon before dinner, and gave us all\\nthe potins (gossip) of that world, very hostile to the Republic, and\\nstill quite believing that their turn would come. His uncle was not of\\nthat opinion. He was a very clever man, a diplomatist who had lived in a\\ngreat many places and known a great many people, and was entirely on the\\nRoyalist side, but he thought their cause was a lost one, at least for a\\ntime. He often asked some of his friends to meet us at dinner, said it\\nwas a good thing for W. to hear what men on the other side thought, and\\nW. was quite pleased to meet them. They were all absolutely opposed to\\nhim in politics, and discussion sometimes ran high, but there was never\\nanything personal--all were men of the world, had seen many changes in\\nFrance in their lives; many had played a part in politics under the\\nformer regimes. It seemed to me that they underrated the intelligence\\nand the strength of the Republican party.\\n\\nOne of the regular habitues was the Marquis de N., a charming man,\\nfairly broad-minded (given the atmosphere he lived in) and sceptical to\\nthe highest degree. He was a great friend of Marshal MacMahon, and had\\nbeen prefet at Pau, where he had a great position. He was very\\ndictatorial, very outspoken, but was a great favourite, particularly\\nwith the English colony, which is large there in the hunting-season. He\\nhad accepted to dine one night with an English family, who lived in a\\nvilla a little out of town. They had an accident en route, which delayed\\nthem very much, and when he and the marquise arrived the party was at\\ntable. He instantly had his carriage called back and left the house in\\nspite of all the explanations and apologies of his host, saying that\\nwhen \"one had the honour of receiving the Marquis de N. one waited\\ndinner for him.\"\\n\\nWe saw always a great deal of him, as his daughter married the Comte de\\nF., who was for some time in W.\\'s cabinet at the Quai d\\'Orsay, and\\nafterward with us the ten years we were at the London Embassy, where\\nthey were quite part of the family. They were both perfectly fitted for\\ndiplomatic life, particularly in England. Both spoke English well, knew\\neverybody, and remembered all the faces and all the names, no easy thing\\nin England, where the names and titles change so often. I know several\\nEnglishwomen who have had four different names. Lady Holland was also a\\nfriend of \"Oncle Alphonse\" and dined there often. She was\\ndelicate-looking, rather quiet in general conversation, though she spoke\\nFrench easily, but was interesting when she was talking to one or two\\npeople. We went often to her beautiful house in London, the first years\\nwe were at the embassy, and always met interesting people. Her salon was\\nvery cosmopolitan--every one who came to London wanted to go to Holland\\nHouse, which was a museum filled with beautiful things.\\n\\nAnother lady who was often at my uncle\\'s was quite a different type,\\nMademoiselle A., an old pupil of the Conservatoire, who had made a short\\ncareer at the Comedie Francaise many years before. She was really\\ncharming, and her stories of the coulisses and the jalousies between the\\nauthors and the actors, particularly the stars (who hardly accepted the\\nslightest observation from the writer of the play), were most amusing.\\nOnce the piece was accepted it passed into the domain of the theatre,\\nand the actors felt at liberty to interpret the roles according to their\\nideas and traditions. She had a perfect diction; it was a delight to\\nhear her. She recited one night one of Alphonse Daudet\\'s little contes,\\n\"Lettres de Mon Moulin,\" I think, beginning--\"Qui n\\'a pas vu Avignon du\\ntemps des Papes n\\'a rien vu.\" One couldn\\'t hear anything more charming,\\nin a perfectly trained voice, and so easily and naturally said.\\n\\nI suppose no one would listen to it in these days. Bridge has suppressed\\nall conversation or music or artistic enjoyment of any kind. It must\\ncome to an end some day like all crazes, but at the present moment it\\nhas destroyed society. It has been a godsend to many people of no\\nparticular importance or position who have used it as a stepping-stone\\nto get into society. If people play a good game of bridge, they are\\nwelcome guests in a great many houses which formerly would have been\\nclosed to them, and it is a great resource to ladies no longer very\\nyoung, widows and spinsters, who find their days long and don\\'t know\\nwhat to do with their lives.\\n\\nNotwithstanding his preoccupations, W. managed to get a few days\\'\\nshooting in November. He shot several times at Rambouillet with Grevy,\\nwho was an excellent shot, and his shooting breakfasts were very\\npleasant. There was plenty of game, everything very well organised, and\\nthe company agreeable. He always asked the ministers, ambassadors, and\\nmany of the leading political men and very often some of his old\\nfriends, lawyers and men of various professions whom W. was delighted\\nto meet. Their ideas didn\\'t run in grooves like most of the men he lived\\nwith, and it was a pleasure to hear talk that wasn\\'t political nor\\npersonal. The vicious attacks upon persons were so trying those first\\ndays of the Republic. Every man who was a little more prominent than his\\nneighbour seemed a target for every kind of insinuation and criticism.\\n\\nWe went for two days to \"Pout,\" Casimir Perier\\'s fine place in the\\ndepartement de l\\'Aube, where we had capital shooting. It was already\\nextremely cold for the season--the big pond in the court was frozen\\nhard, and the wind whistled about our ears when we drove in an open\\ncarriage to join the shooters at breakfast. Even I, who don\\'t usually\\nfeel the cold, was thankful to be well wrapped up in furs. The Pavillon\\nd\\'Hiver looked very inviting as we drove up--an immense fire was blazing\\nin the chimney, another just outside, where the soup and ragout for the\\narmy of beaters were being prepared. We all had nice little foot-warmers\\nunder our chairs, and were as comfortable as possible. It was too warm\\nin fact when the shooters came in and we sat down to breakfast. We were\\nobliged to open the door. The talk was entirely \"shop\" at breakfast,\\nevery man telling what he had killed, or missed, and the minute they\\nhad finished breakfast, they started off again. We followed one or two\\nbattues (pheasants), but it was really too cold, and we were glad to\\nwalk home to get warm.\\n\\nThe dinner and evening were pleasant--everybody talking--most of them\\ncriticising the Government freely. W. didn\\'t mind, they were all\\nfriends. He defended himself sometimes, merely asking what they would\\nhave done in his place--he was quite ready to receive any\\nsuggestions--but nothing practical ever came out of the discussions. I\\nthink the most delightful political position in the world must be\\n\"leader of the opposition\"--you have no responsibilities, can\\nconcentrate all your energies in pointing out the weak spots in your\\nadversary\\'s armour, and have always your work cut out for you, for as\\nsoon as one ministry falls, you can set to work to demolish its\\nsuccessor, which seems the most interesting occupation possible.\\n\\nThe great question which was disturbing the Chambers and the country was\\nthe general amnesty. That, of course, W. would never agree to. There\\nmight be exceptions. Some of the men who took part in the Commune were\\nso young, little more than lads, carried away by the example of their\\nelders and the excitement of the moment, and there were fiery patriotic\\narticles in almost all the Republican papers inviting France to make the\\nbeau geste of la mere patrie and open her arms to her misguided\\nchildren, and various sensible experienced men really thought it would\\nbe better to wipe out everything and start again with no dark memories\\nto cast a shadow on the beginnings of the young Republic. How many\\nbrilliant, sanguine, impossible theories I heard advanced all those\\ndays, and how the few remaining members of the Centre Gauche tried to\\nreason with the most liberal men of the Centre Droit and to persuade\\nthem frankly to face the fact that the country had sent a strong\\nRepublican majority to Parliament and to make the best of the fait\\naccompli. I suppose it was asking too much of them to go back on the\\ntraditions of their lives, but after all they were Frenchmen, their\\ncountry was just recovering from a terrible disaster, and had need of\\nall her children. During the Franco-Prussian War all party feeling was\\nforgotten. Every man was first a Frenchman in the face of a foreign foe,\\nand if they could have stood firmly together in those first days after\\nthe war the strength of the country would have been wonderful. All\\nEurope was astounded at the way in which France paid her milliards,--no\\none more so than Bismarck, who is supposed to have said that, if he\\ncould have dreamed that France could pay that enormous sum so quickly,\\nhe would have asked much more.\\n\\nDecember was very cold, snow and ice everywhere, and very hard frosts,\\nwhich didn\\'t give way at all when the sun came out occasionally in the\\nmiddle of the day. Everybody was skating, not only at the clubs of the\\nBois de Boulogne, but on the lakes, which happens very rarely, as the\\nwater is fairly deep. The Seine was full of large blocks of ice, which\\ngot jammed up against the bridges and made a jarring ugly sound as they\\nknocked against each other. The river steamers had stopped running, and\\nthere were crowds of flaneurs loitering on the quais and bridges\\nwondering if the cold would last long enough for the river to be quite\\nfrozen over.\\n\\nW. and I went two or three times to the Cercle des Patineurs at the Bois\\nde Boulogne, and had a good skate. The women didn\\'t skate as well then\\nas they do now, but they looked very pretty in their costumes of velvet\\nand sables. It was funny to see them stumbling over the ice with a man\\nsupporting them on each side. However, they enjoyed it very much. It was\\nbeautiful winter weather, very cold but no wind, and it was very good\\nexercise. All the world was there, and the afternoons passed quickly\\nenough. I had not skated for years, having spent all my winters in\\nItaly, but on the principle that you never forget anything that you know\\nwell, I thought I would try, and will say that the first half-hour was\\nabsolute suffering. It was in the old days when one still wore a strap\\nover the instep, which naturally was drawn very tight. My feet were like\\nlumps of ice, as heavy as lead, and I didn\\'t seem able to lift them from\\nthe ground. I went back to the dressing-room to take my skates off for a\\nfew minutes, and when the blood began to circulate again, I could have\\ncried with the pain. A friend of mine, a beginner, who was sitting near\\nwaiting to have her skates put on, was rather discouraged, and said to\\nme: \"You don\\'t look as if you were enjoying yourself. I don\\'t think I\\nwill try.\" \"Oh yes you must,--\\'les commencements sont toujours\\ndifficiles,\\' and you will learn. I shall be all right as soon as I start\\nagain.\" She looked rather doubtful, but I saw her again later in the\\nday, when I had forgotten all about my sufferings, and she was skating\\nas easily as I did when I was a girl. I think one must learn young.\\nAfter all, it is more or less a question of balance. When one is young\\none doesn\\'t mind a fall.\\n\\nW., who had retired to a corner to practise a little by himself, told me\\nthat one of his friends, Comte de Pourtales, not at all of his way of\\nthinking in politics, an Imperialist, was much pleased with a little jeu\\nd\\'esprit he had made at his expense. W. caught the top of his skate in a\\ncrevice in the ice, and came down rather heavily in a sitting posture.\\nComte de Pourtales, who was standing near on the bank, saw the fall and\\ncalled out instantly, \"Est-ce possible que je voie le President du\\nConseil par terre?\" (Is it possible that the President du Conseil has\\nfallen?) The little joke was quite de bonne guerre and quite\\nappropriate, as the cabinet was tottering and very near its fall. It\\namused W. quite as much as it did the bystanders.\\n\\nThe cold was increasing every day, the ground was frozen hard, the\\nstreets very slippery, and going very difficult. All our horses were\\nrough shod, but even with that we made very slow progress. Some of the\\nomnibuses were on runners, and one or two of the young men of the\\nministry had taken off the wheels of their light carriages and put them\\non runners, but one didn\\'t see many real sleighs or sledges, as they\\ncall them here. I fancy \"sleigh\" is entirely an American expression. The\\nSeine was at last completely taken, and the public was allowed on the\\nice, which was very thick. It was a very pretty, animated sight, many\\nbooths like those one sees on the Boulevard during the Christmas\\nholidays were installed on the ice close to the banks, and the river was\\nblack with people. They couldn\\'t skate much, as the ice was rough and\\nthere were too many people, but they ran and slid and shouted and\\nenjoyed themselves immensely. I wanted to cross one day with my boy,\\nthat he might say he had crossed the Seine on foot, but W. was rather\\nunwilling. However, the prefet de la Seine, whom he consulted, told him\\nthere was absolutely no danger--the ice was several inches thick, so I\\nstarted off one afternoon, one of the secretaries going with me. He was\\nmuch astonished and rather nervous at seeing me in my ordinary boots. He\\nhad nails in his, and one of our friends whom we met on the ice had\\nwoollen socks over his boots. They were sure I would slip and perhaps\\nget a bad fall. \"But no one could slip on that ice; it is quite rough,\\nmight almost be a ploughed field,\"--but they were uncomfortable, and\\nwere very pleased when I landed safely on the other side and got into\\nthe carriage. Just in the middle the boys had swept a path on the ice to\\nmake a glissade. They were racing up and down in bands, and the constant\\npassing had made it quite level and very slippery. We saw three or four\\nunwary pedestrians get a fall, but if one kept on the outside near the\\nbank there was no danger of slipping.\\n\\nThe extreme cold lasting so long brought many discomforts. Many trains\\nwith wood and provisions couldn\\'t get to Paris. The railroads were all\\nblocked and the Parisians were getting uneasy, fearing they might run\\nshort of food and fuel. We were very comfortable in the big rooms of the\\nministry. There were roaring fires everywhere, and two or three\\ncaloriferes. The view from the windows on the Quai was charming as long\\nas the great cold lasted, particularly at night, when the river was\\nalive with people, lights and coloured lanterns, and music. Every now\\nand then there would be a ronde or a farandole,--the farandole forcing\\nits way through the crowd, every one carrying a lantern and looking like\\na brilliant snake winding in and out.\\n\\nWe had some people dining one night, and they couldn\\'t keep away from\\nthe windows. Some of the young ones (English) wanted to go down and have\\na lark on the ice, but it wasn\\'t possible. The crowd, though thoroughly\\ngood-humoured, merely bent on enjoying themselves, had degenerated into\\na rabble. One would have been obliged to have a strong escort of police,\\nand besides in evening dress, even with fur cloaks and the fur and\\nwoollen boots every one wore over their thin shoes, one would certainly\\nhave risked getting a bad attack of pneumonia. One of our great friends,\\nSir Henry Hoare, was dining that night, but he didn\\'t want to go down,\\npreferred smoking his cigar in a warm room and talking politics to W. He\\nhad been a great deal in Paris, knew everybody, and was a member of the\\nJockey Club. He was much interested in French politics and au fond was\\nvery liberal, quite sympathised with W. and his friends and shared their\\nopinions on most subjects, though as he said, \"I don\\'t air those\\nopinions at the Jockey Club.\" He came often to our big receptions, liked\\nto see all the people. He too used to tell me all that was said in his\\nclub about the Republic and the Government, but he was a shrewd\\nobserver, had been a long time an M.P. in England, and had come to the\\nconclusion that the talk at the clubs was chiefly a \"pose,\"--they didn\\'t\\nreally have many illusions about the restoration of the monarchy,\\ncouldn\\'t have, when even the Duc de Broglie with his intelligence and\\nfollowing (the Faubourg St. Germain followed him blindly) could do\\nnothing but make a constitutional Republic with Marshal MacMahon at\\nits head.\\n\\nIt was always said too that the women were more uncompromising than the\\nmen. I went one afternoon to a concert at the Austrian Embassy, given in\\naid of some inundations, which had been a catastrophe for that country,\\nhundreds of houses, and people and cattle swept away! The French public\\nhad responded most generously, as they always do, to the urgent appeal\\nmade by the ambassador in the name of the Emperor, and the Government\\nhad contributed largely to the fund. Count Beust the Austrian ambassador\\nwas obliged of course to invite the Government and Madame Grevy to the\\nentertainment, as well as his friends of the Faubourg St. Germain.\\nNeither Madame nor Mademoiselle Grevy came, but some of the ministers\\'\\nwives did, and it was funny to see the ladies of society looking at the\\nRepublican ladies, as if they were denizens of a different planet,\\nstrange figures they were not accustomed to see. It is curious to think\\nof all that now, when relations are much less strained. I remember not\\nvery long ago at a party at one of the embassies, seeing many of the\\nsociety women having themselves presented to the wife of the then\\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, with whom they certainly had nothing in\\ncommon, neither birth, breeding, nor mode of life. I was talking to\\nCasimir Perier (late President of the Republic) and it amused us very\\nmuch to see the various introductions and the great empressement of the\\nladies, all of whom were asking to be presented to Madame R. \"What can\\nall those women want?\" I asked him. He replied promptly, \"Embassies for\\ntheir husbands.\" It would have been better, I think, in a worldly point\\nof view, if more embassies had been given to the bearers of some of the\\ngreat names of France--but there were so many candidates for every\\ndescription of function in France just then, from an ambassador to a\\ngendarme, that anybody who had anything to give found himself in a\\ndifficult position.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\nLAST DAYS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE\\n\\nThe end of December was detestable. We were en pleine crise for ten\\ndays. Every day W. went to the Chamber of Deputies expecting to be\\nbeaten, and every evening came home discouraged and disgusted. The\\nChamber was making the position of the ministers perfectly\\nuntenable--all sorts of violent and useless propositions were discussed,\\nand there was an undercurrent of jealousy and intrigue everywhere. One\\nday, just before Christmas, about the 20th, W. and his chef de cabinet,\\nComte de P., started for the house, after breakfast--W. expecting to be\\nbeaten by a coalition vote of the extreme Left, Bonapartists and\\nLegitimists. It was an insane policy on the part of the two last, as\\nthey knew perfectly well they wouldn\\'t gain anything by upsetting the\\nactual cabinet. They would only get another one much more advanced and\\nmore masterful. I suppose their idea was to have a succession of radical\\ninefficient ministers, which in the end would disgust the country and\\nmake a \"saviour,\" a prince (which one?) or general, possible. How wise\\ntheir reasoning was time has shown! I wanted to go to the Chamber to\\nhear the debate, but W. didn\\'t want me. He would be obliged to speak,\\nand said it would worry him if I were in the gallery listening to all\\nthe attacks made upon him. (It is rather curious that I never heard him\\nspeak in public, either in the house or in the country, where he often\\nmade political speeches, in election times.) He was so sure that the\\nministry would fall that we had already begun cleaning and making fires\\nin our own house, so on that afternoon, as I didn\\'t want to sit at home\\nwaiting for telegrams, I went up to the house with Henrietta. The\\ncaretaker had already told us that the stock of wood and coal was giving\\nout, and she couldn\\'t get any more in the quarter, and if she couldn\\'t\\nmake fires the pipes would burst, which was a pleasant prospect with the\\nthermometer at I don\\'t remember how many degrees below zero. We found a\\nfine cleaning going on--doors and windows open all over the house--and\\nwomen scrubbing stairs, floors, and windows, rather under difficulties,\\nwith little fire and little water. It looked perfectly dreary and\\ncomfortless--not at all tempting. All the furniture was piled up in the\\nmiddle of the rooms, and W.\\'s library was a curiosity. Books and\\npamphlets accumulated rapidly with us, W. was a member of many literary\\nsocieties of all kinds all over the world, and packages and boxes of\\nunopened books quite choked up the room. H. and I tried to arrange\\nthings a little, but it was hopeless that day, and, besides, the house\\nwas bitterly cold. It didn\\'t feel as if a fire could make any\\nimpression.\\n\\nAs we could do nothing there, we went back to the ministry. No telegrams\\nhad come, but Kruft, our faithful and efficient chef du materiel, was\\nwaiting for me for last instructions about a Christmas tree. Some days\\nbefore I had decided to have a Christmas tree, about the end of the\\nmonth. W. then thought the ministry would last over the holidays, the\\ntreve des confiseurs, and was quite willing I should have a Christmas\\nparty as a last entertainment. He had been too occupied the last days to\\nthink about any such trifles, and Kruft, not having had any contrary\\ninstructions, had ordered the presents and decorations. He was rather\\ndepressed, because W. had told him that morning that we surely would not\\nbe at the Quai d\\'Orsay on the 29th, the day we had chosen for our party.\\nHowever, I reassured him, and told him we would have the Christmas tree\\nall the same, only at my house instead of at the ministry. We went to\\nlook at his presents, which were all spread out on a big table in one of\\nthe drawing-rooms. He really was a wonderful man, never forgot anything,\\nand had remembered that at the last tree, the year before, one or two\\nnurses had had no presents, and several who had were not pleased with\\nwhat was given to them. He had made a very good selection for those\\nladies,--lace scarfs and rabats and little tours de cou of fur,--really\\nvery pretty. I believe they were satisfied this time. The young men of\\nthe Chancery sent me up two telegrams: \"rien de nouveau,\"--\"ministere\\ndebout.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: M. de Freyeinet. After a photograph by M. Nadaz, Paris]\\n\\nW. came home late, very tired and much disgusted with politics in\\ngeneral and his party in particular. The cabinet still lived, but merely\\nto give Grevy time to make another. W. had been to the Elysee and had a\\nlong conversation with Grevy. He found him very preoccupied, very\\nunwilling to make a change, and he again urged W. very much to keep the\\nForeign Office, if Freycinet should succeed in making a ministry. That\\nW. would not agree to--he was sick of the whole thing. He told Grevy he\\nwas quite right to send for Freycinet--if any man could save the\\nsituation he could. We had one or two friends, political men, to dinner,\\nand they discussed the situation from every point of view, always\\nending with the same conclusion, that W. was right to go. His policy\\nwasn\\'t the policy of the Chamber (I don\\'t say of the country, for I\\nthink the country knew little and cared less about what was going on in\\nParliament), hardly the policy of all his own colleagues. There was\\nreally no use to continue worrying himself to death and doing no good.\\nW. said his conversation with Grevy was interesting, but he was much\\nmore concerned with home politics and the sweeping changes the\\nRepublicans wanted to make in all the administrations than with foreign\\npolicy. He said Europe was quiet and France\\'s first duty was to\\nestablish herself firmly, which would only be done by peace and\\nprosperity at home. I told W. I had spent a very cold and uncomfortable\\nhour at the house, and I was worried about the cold, thought I might,\\nperhaps, send the boy to mother, but he had taken his precautions and\\narranged with the Minister of War to have a certain amount of wood\\ndelivered at the house. They always had reserves of wood at the various\\nministries. We had ours directly from our own woods in the country, and\\nit was en route, but a flotilla of boats was frozen up in the Canal de\\nl\\'Ourcq, and it might be weeks before the wood could be delivered.\\n\\nWe dined one night at the British Embassy, while all these pourparlers\\nwere going on, en petit comite, all English, Lord and Lady Reay, Lord\\nEdmond Fitz-Maurice, and one or two members of Parliament whose names I\\nhave forgotten. Both Lord and Lady Reay were very keen about politics,\\nknew France well, and were much interested in the phase she was passing\\nthrough. Lord Lyons was charming, so friendly and sensible, said he\\nwasn\\'t surprised at W.\\'s wanting to go--still hoped this crisis would\\npass like so many others he had seen in France; that certainly W.\\'s\\npresence at the Foreign Office during the last year had been a help to\\nthe Republic--said also he didn\\'t believe his retirement would last very\\nlong. It was frightfully cold when we came out of the embassy--very few\\ncarriages out, all the coachmen wrapped up in mufflers and fur caps, and\\nthe Place de la Concorde a sea of ice so slippery I thought we should\\nnever get across and over the bridge. I went to the opera one night that\\nweek, got there in an entr\\'acte, when people were walking about and\\nreading the papers. As I passed several groups of men, I heard W.\\'s name\\nmentioned, also that of Leon Say and Freycinet, but just in passing by\\nquickly I could not hear any comments. I fancy they were not favourable\\nin that milieu. It was very cold in the house--almost all the women had\\ntheir cloaks on--and the coming out was something awful, crossing that\\nbroad perron in the face of a biting wind.\\n\\nI began my packing seriously this time, as W.\\'s mind was quite made up.\\nHe had thought the matter well over, and had a final talk with\\nFreycinet, who would have liked to keep both W. and Leon Say, but it\\nwasn\\'t easy to manage the new element that Freycinet brought with him.\\nThe new members were much more advanced in their opinions. W. couldn\\'t\\nhave worked with them, and they certainly didn\\'t want to work with him.\\nThe autumn session came to a turbulent end on the 26th of December, and\\nthe next day the papers announced that the ministers had given their\\nresignations to the President, who had accepted them and had charged M.\\nde Freycinet to form a cabinet. We dined with mother on Christmas day, a\\nfamily party, with the addition of Comte de P. and one or two stray\\nAmericans who were at hotels and were of course delighted not to dine on\\nChristmas day at a table d\\'hote or cafe. W. was rather tired; the\\nconstant talking and seeing so many people of all kinds was very\\nfatiguing, for, as long as his resignation was not official, announced\\nin the _Journal Officiel_, he was still Minister of Foreign Affairs.\\nOne of the last days, when they were hoping to come to an agreement, he\\nwas obliged to come home early to receive the mission from Morocco. I\\nsaw them arrive; they were a fine set of men, tall, powerfully built,\\ntheir skin a red-brown, not black, entirely dressed in white from\\nturbans to sandals. None of them spoke any French--all the conversation\\ntook place through an interpreter. Notwithstanding our worries, we had a\\nvery pleasant evening and W. was very cheerful--looking forward to our\\nItalian trip with quite as much pleasure as I did.\\n\\nW. made over the ministry to Freycinet on Monday, the 28th, the\\ntransmission des pouvoirs. Freycinet was very nice and friendly,\\nregretted that he and W. were no longer colleagues. He thought his\\nministry was strong and was confident he would manage the Chamber. W.\\ntold him he could settle himself as soon as he liked at the Quai\\nd\\'Orsay, as we should go at once, and would sleep at our house on\\nWednesday night. Freycinet said Madame de Freycinet (whom I knew well\\nand liked very much) would come and see me on Wednesday, and would like\\nto go over the house with me. I was rather taken aback when W. told me\\nwe must sleep in our own house on Wednesday night. The actual packing\\nwas not very troublesome, as I had not brought many of my own things\\nfrom the rue Dumont d\\'Urville. There was scarcely a van-load of small\\nfurniture and boxes, but the getting together of all the small things\\nwas a bore,--books, bibelots, music, cards, and notes (these in\\nquantities, lettres de condoleance, which had to be carefully sorted as\\nthey had all to be answered). The hotel of the Quai d\\'Orsay was crowded\\nwith people those last two days, all W.\\'s friends coming to express\\ntheir regrets at his departure, some very sincerely sorry to see him go,\\nas his name and character certainly inspired confidence abroad--and some\\ndelighted that he was no longer a member of such an advanced\\ncabinet--(some said \"de cet infect gouvernement\"), where he was obliged\\nby his mere presence to sanction many things he didn\\'t approve of. He\\nand Freycinet had a long talk on Wednesday, as W. naturally wanted to be\\nsure that some provision would be made for his chef de cabinet and\\nsecretaries. Each incoming minister brings his own staff with him.\\nFreycinet offered W. the London Embassy, but he wouldn\\'t take it, had\\nhad enough of public life for the present. I didn\\'t want it either, I\\nhad never lived much in England, had not many friends there, and was\\ncounting the days until we could get off to Rome. There was one funny\\nresult of W. having declined the London Embassy. Admiral Pothnau, whom\\nW. had named there, and who was very much liked, came to see him one day\\nand made a great scene because Freycinet had offered him the London\\nEmbassy. W. said he didn\\'t understand why he made a scene, as he had\\nrefused it. \"But it should never have been offered to you over my head.\"\\n\"Perhaps, but that is not my fault. I didn\\'t ask for it--and don\\'t want\\nit. If you think you have been treated badly, you should speak to\\nFreycinet.\" However, the admiral was very much put out, and was very\\ncool with us both for a long time. I suppose his idea was that being\\nrecalled would mean that he had not done well in London, which was quite\\na mistake, as he was very much liked there.\\n\\nWe dined alone that last night at the ministry, and sat some time in the\\nwindow, looking at the crowds of people amusing themselves on the Seine,\\nand wondering if we should ever see the Quai d\\'Orsay again. After all,\\nwe had had two very happy interesting years there--and memories that\\nwould last a lifetime.--Some of the last experiences of the month of\\nDecember had been rather disillusioning, but I suppose one must not\\nbring any sentiment into politics. In the world it is always a case of\\ndonnant--donnant--and--when one is no longer in a position to give a\\ngreat deal--people naturally turn to the rising man. Comte de P., chef\\nde cabinet, came in late as usual, to have a last talk. He too had been\\nbusy, as he had a small apartment and stables in the hotel of the\\nministry, and was also very anxious to get away. He told us all the\\nyoung men of the cabinet were very sorry to see W. go--at first they had\\nfound him a little cold and reserved--but a two years\\' experience had\\nshown them that, if he were not expansive, he was perfectly just, and\\nalways did what he said he would.\\n\\nThe next day Madame de Freycinet came to see me, and we went over the\\nhouse. She didn\\'t care about the living-rooms, as they never lived at\\nthe Quai d\\'Orsay, remained in their own hotel near the Bois de Boulogne.\\nFreycinet came every day to the ministry, and she merely on reception\\ndays--or when there was a party. Just as she was going, Madame de\\nZuylen, wife of the Dutch minister, a great friend of mine, came in. She\\ntold me she had great difficulty in getting up, as I had forbidden my\\ndoor, but my faithful Gerard (I think I missed him as much as anything\\nelse at first) knowing we were friends, thought Madame would like to see\\nher. She paid me quite a long visit,--I even gave her some tea off\\ngovernment plate and china,--all mine had been already sent to my own\\nhouse. We sat talking for some time. She had heard that W. had refused\\nthe London Embassy, was afraid it was a mistake, and that the winter in\\nParis would be a difficult one for him--he would certainly be in\\nopposition to the Government on all sorts of questions--and if he\\nremained in Paris he would naturally go to the Senate and vote. I quite\\nagreed that he couldn\\'t suddenly detach himself from all political\\ndiscussions--must take part in them and must vote. The policy of\\nabstention has always seemed to me the weakest possible line in\\npolitics. If a man, for some reason or another, hasn\\'t the courage of\\nhis opinions, he mustn\\'t take any position where that opinion would\\ncarry weight. I told her we were going to Italy as soon as we could get\\noff after the holidays.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, a message came up to say that the young men of\\nthe cabinet were all coming up to say good-bye to me. I had seen the\\ndirectors earlier in the day, so Madame de Zuylen took her leave,\\npromising to come to my Christmas tree in the rue Dumont d\\'Urville. The\\nyoung men seemed sorry to say good-bye--I was, too. I had seen a great\\ndeal of them and always found them ready and anxious to help me in\\nevery way. The Comte de Lasteyrie, who was a great friend of ours as\\nwell as a secretary, went about a great deal with us. W. called upon him\\nvery often for all sorts of things, knowing he could trust him\\nabsolutely. He told one of my friends that one of his principal\\nfunctions was to accompany Madame Waddington to all the charity sales,\\ncarrying a package of women\\'s chemises under his arm. It was quite true\\nthat I often bought \"poor clothes\" at the sales. The objects exposed in\\nthe way of screens, pincushions, table-covers, and, in the spring, hats\\nmade by some of the ladies, were so appalling that I was glad to have\\npoor clothes to fall back upon, but I don\\'t remember his ever carrying\\nmy purchases home with me.\\n\\nThey were much amused when suddenly Francis burst into the room, having\\nescaped a moment from his Nonnon, who was busy with her last packing,\\nhis little face flushed and quivering with anger because his toys had\\nbeen packed and he was to be taken away from the big house. He kicked\\nand screamed like a little mad thing, until his nurse came to the\\nrescue. I made a last turn in the rooms to see that all trace of my\\noccupation had vanished. Francis, half pacified, was seated on the\\nbilliard-table, an old grey-haired huissier, who was always on duty\\nup-stairs, taking care of him. The huissiers and house servants were all\\nassembled in the hall, and the old Pierson, who had been there for\\nyears, was the spokesman, and hoped respectfully that Madame \"would soon\\ncome back....\" W. didn\\'t come with us, as he still had people to see and\\nonly got home in time for a late dinner.\\n\\nWe dined that night and for many nights afterward with our uncle\\nLutteroth (who had a charming hotel filled with pictures and bibelots\\nand pretty things) just across the street, as it was some little time\\nbefore our kitchen and household got into working order again. The first\\nfew days were, of course, very tiring and uncomfortable--the house\\nseemed so small after the big rooms at the Quai d\\'Orsay. I didn\\'t\\nattempt to do anything with the salons, as we were going away so\\nsoon--carpets and curtains had to be arranged to keep the cold out, but\\nthe big boxes remained in the carriage house--not unpacked. We had a\\nprocession of visitors all day--and tried to make W.\\'s library\\npossible--comfortable it wasn\\'t, as there were packages of books and\\npapers and boxes everywhere.\\n\\nI had a good many visits and flowers on New Year\\'s day--which was an\\nagreeable surprise--Lord Lyons, Orloff, the Sibberns, Comte de Sigur,\\nM. Alfred Andre, and others. Andre, an old friend of W.\\'s, a very\\nconservative Protestant banker, was very blue about affairs. Andre was\\nthe type of the modern French Protestant. They are almost a separate\\nclass in France--are very earnest, religious, honourable, narrow-minded\\npeople. They give a great deal in charity and good works of all kinds.\\nIn Paris the Protestant coterie is very rich. They associate with all\\nthe Catholics, as many of them entertain a great deal, but they live\\namong themselves and never intermarry. I hardly know a case where a\\nFrench Protestant has married a Catholic. I suppose it is a remnant of\\ntheir old Huguenot blood, and the memories of all their forefathers\\nsuffered for their religion, which makes them so intolerant. The\\nambassadors had paid their usual official visit to the Elysee--said\\nGrevy was very smiling and amiable, didn\\'t seem at all preoccupied. We\\nhad a family dinner at my uncle\\'s on New Year\\'s night, and all the\\nfamily with wonderful unanimity said the best wish they could make for\\nW. was that 1880 would see him out of politics and leading an\\nindependent if less interesting life.\\n\\nAn interesting life it certainly was, hearing so many questions\\ndiscussed, seeing all sorts of people of all nationalities and living as\\nit were behind the scenes. The Chamber of Deputies in itself was a\\nstudy, with its astounding changes of opinion, with no apparent cause.\\nOne never knew in the morning what the afternoon\\'s session would bring,\\nfor as soon as the Republican party felt themselves firmly established,\\nthey began to quarrel among themselves. I went back to the ministry one\\nafternoon to pay a formal visit to Madame de Freycinet on her reception\\nday. I had rather put it off, thinking that the sight of the well-known\\nrooms and faces would be disagreeable to me and make me regret, perhaps,\\nthe past, but I felt already that all that old life was over--one adapts\\none\\'s self so quickly to different surroundings. It did seem funny to be\\nannounced by my own special huissier, Gerard, and to find myself sitting\\nin the green drawing-room with all the palms and flowers arranged just\\nas they always were for me, and a semicircle of diplomats saying exactly\\nthe same things to Madame de Freycinet that they had said to me a few\\ndays before, but I fancy that always happens in these days of democracy\\nand equalising education, and that under certain circumstances, we all\\nsay and do exactly the same thing. I had quite a talk with Sibbern, the\\nSwedish minister, who was very friendly and sympathetic, not only at our\\nleaving the Foreign Office, but at the extreme discomfort of moving in\\nsuch frightfully cold weather. He was wrapped in furs, as if he were\\ngoing to the North Pole. However, I assured him we were quite warm and\\ncomfortable, gradually settling down into our old ways, and I was\\nalready looking back on my two years at the Quai d\\'Orsay as an agreeable\\nepisode in my life. I had quite a talk too with the Portuguese minister,\\nMendes Leal. He was an interesting man, a poet and a dreamer, saw more,\\nI fancy, of the literary world of Paris than the political. Blowitz was\\nthere, of course--was always everywhere in moments of crisis, talking a\\ngreat deal, and letting it be understood that he had pulled a great many\\nwires all those last weeks. He too regretted that W. had not taken the\\nLondon Embassy, assured me that it would have been a very agreeable\\nappointment in England--was surprised that I hadn\\'t urged it. I replied\\nthat I had not been consulted. Many people asked when they could come\\nand see me--would I take up my reception day again? That wasn\\'t worth\\nwhile, as I was going away so soon, but I said I would be there every\\nday at five o\\'clock, and always had visits.\\n\\n[Illustration: Mme. Sadi Carnot. From a drawing by Mlle. Amelie\\nBeaury-Saurel.]\\n\\nOne day Madame Sadi Carnot sat a long time with me. Her husband had been\\nnamed undersecretary at the Ministry of Public Works in the new\\ncabinet, and she was very pleased. She was a very charming, intelligent,\\ncultivated woman--read a great deal, was very keen about politics and\\nvery ambitious (as every clever woman should be) for her husband and\\nsons. I think she was a great help socially to her husband when he\\nbecame President of the Republic. He was a grave, reserved man, didn\\'t\\ncare very much for society. I saw her very often and always found her\\nmost attractive. At the Elysee she was amiable and courteous to\\neverybody and her slight deafness didn\\'t seem to worry her nor make\\nconversation difficult. She did such a charming womanly thing just after\\nher husband\\'s assassination. He lay in state for some days at the\\nElysee, and M. Casimir Perier, his successor, went to make her a visit.\\nAs he was leaving he said his wife would come the next day to see Madame\\nCarnot. She instantly answered, \"Pray do not let her come; she is young,\\nbeginning her life here at the Elysee. I wouldn\\'t for worlds that she\\nshould have the impression of sadness and gloom that must hang over the\\npalace as long as the President is lying there. I should like her to\\ncome to the Elysee only when all traces of this tragedy have gone--and\\nto have no sad associations--on the contrary, with the prospect of a\\nlong happy future before her.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Photograph, copyright by Pierre Petit, Paris._\\nPresident Sadi Carnot.]\\n\\nW. went the two or three Fridays we were in Paris to the Institute,\\nwhere he was most warmly received by his colleagues, who had much\\nregretted his enforced absences the years he was at the Foreign Office.\\nHe told them he was going to Rome, where he hoped still to find some\\ntreasures in the shape of inscriptions inedites, with the help of his\\nfriend Lanciani. The days passed quickly enough until we started. It was\\nnot altogether a rest, as there were always so many people at the house,\\nand W. wanted to put order into his papers before he left. Freycinet\\nmade various changes at the Quai d\\'Orsay. M. Desprey, Directeur de la\\nPolitique (a post he had occupied for years) was named ambassador to\\nRome in the place of the Marquis de Gabriac. I don\\'t think he was very\\nanxious to go. His career had been made almost entirely at the Foreign\\nOffice, and he was much more at home in his cabinet, with all his papers\\nand books about him, than he would be abroad among strangers. He came to\\ndinner one night, and we talked the thing over. W. thought the rest and\\nchange would do him good. He was named to the Vatican, where necessarily\\nthere was much less to do in the way of social life than at the\\nQuirinal. He was perfectly au courant of all the questions between the\\nVatican and the French clergy--his son, secretary of embassy, would go\\nwith him. It seemed rather a pleasant prospect.\\n\\nW. went once or twice to the Senate, as the houses met on the 12th or\\n14th of January, but there was nothing very interesting those first\\ndays. The Chamber was taking breath after the holidays and the last\\nministerial crisis, and giving the new ministry a chance. I think\\nFreycinet had his hands full, but he was quite equal to the task. I went\\nlate one afternoon to the Elysee. I had written to Madame Grevy to ask\\nif she would receive me before I left for Italy. When I arrived, the one\\nfootman at the door told me Madame Grevy was un peu souffrante, would\\nsee me up-stairs. I went up a side staircase, rather dark, preceded by\\nthe footman, who ushered me into Madame Grevy\\'s bedroom. It looked\\nperfectly uncomfortable--was large, with very high ceilings, stiff gilt\\nfurniture standing against the wall, and the heat something awful,--a\\nblazing fire in the chimney. Madame Grevy was sitting in an armchair,\\nnear the fire, a grey shawl on her shoulders and a lace fichu on her\\nhead. It was curiously unlike the bedroom I had just left. I had been to\\nsee a friend, who was also souffrante. She was lying under a lace\\ncoverlet lined with pink silk, lace, and embroidered cushions all\\naround her, flowers, pink lamp-shades, silver flacons, everything most\\nluxurious and modern. The contrast was striking. Madame Grevy was very\\ncivil, and talkative,--said she was very tired. The big dinners and late\\nhours she found very fatiguing. She quite understood that I was glad to\\nget away, but didn\\'t think it was very prudent to travel in such\\nbitterly cold weather--and Rome was very far, and wasn\\'t I afraid of\\nfever? I told her I was an old Roman--had lived there for years, knew\\nthe climate well, and didn\\'t think it was worse than any other. She said\\nthe President had had a visit from W. and a very long talk with him, and\\nthat he regretted his departure very much, but that he didn\\'t think\\n\"Monsieur Waddington was au fond de son sac.\" Grevy was always a good\\nfriend to W.--on one or two occasions, when there was a sort of cabal\\nagainst him, Grevy took his part very warmly--and in all questions of\\nhome policy and persons W. found him a very keen, shrewd\\nobserver--though he said very little--rarely expressed an opinion. I\\ndidn\\'t make a very long visit--found my way down-stairs as well as I\\ncould--no servant was visible either on the stairs or in the hall, and\\nmy own footman opened the big doors and let me out. We got off the first\\ndays of February--as, up to the last moment, W. had people to see. We\\nwent for two or three days to Bourneville--I had one or two very cold\\ntramps in the woods (very dry) which is quite unusual at this time of\\nthe year, but the earth was frozen hard. Inside the woods we were well\\nsheltered, but when we came out on the plain the cold and icy wind was\\nawful. The workmen had made fires to burn the roots and rotten wood, and\\nwe were very glad to stop and warm ourselves. Some had their children\\nwith them, who looked half perished with cold, always insufficiently\\nclad, but they were quite happy roasting potatoes in the ashes. I was so\\ncold that I tied a woollen scarf around my head, just as the women in\\nCanada do when they go sleighing or skating.\\n\\nWe had a breakfast one day for some of W.\\'s influential men in the\\ncountry, who were much disgusted at the turn affairs had taken and that\\nW. could no longer remain minister, but they were very fairly au courant\\nof all that was going on in Parliament, and quite understood that for\\nthe moment the moderate, experienced men had no chance.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\\'s\\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\\n\\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\\ndownload by the etext year.\\n\\n     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\\n\\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\\n\\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\\n\\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\\n\\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'A note from Michael Hart, preparer of the 0.1 version.\\n\\nThis file contains a number of versions of the Magna Carta,\\nsome of which were a little mangled in transit.  I am sure\\nour volunteers will find and correct errors I didn\\'t catch,\\nand that version 0.2 - 1.0 will have significant improvements,\\nas well as at least one more version in Latin.\\n\\nVersion 1.0 may contain a dozen different versions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Text of Magna Carta\\n\\nJOHN, by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of\\nNormandy and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his archbishops,\\nbishops, abbots, earls, barons, justices, foresters, sheriffs,\\nstewards, servants, and to all his officials and loyal subjects,\\nGreeting.\\n\\nKNOW THAT BEFORE GOD, for the health of our soul and those of our\\nancestors and heirs, to the honour of God, the exaltation of the holy\\nChurch, and the better ordering of our kingdom, at the advice of our\\nreverend fathers Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all\\nEngland, and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry archbishop of\\nDublin, William bishop of London, Peter bishop of Winchester, Jocelin\\nbishop of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh bishop of Lincoln, Walter Bishop\\nof Worcester, William bishop of Coventry, Benedict bishop of\\nRochester, Master Pandulf subdeacon and member of the papal household,\\nBrother Aymeric master of the knighthood of the Temple in England,\\nWilliam Marshal earl of Pembroke, William earl of Salisbury, William\\nearl of Warren, William earl of Arundel, Alan de Galloway constable of\\nScotland, Warin Fitz Gerald, Peter Fitz Herbert, Hubert de Burgh\\nseneschal of Poitou, Hugh de Neville, Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas\\nBasset, Alan Basset, Philip Daubeny, Robert de Roppeley, John Marshal,\\nJohn Fitz Hugh, and other loyal subjects:\\n\\n(1) FIRST, THAT WE HAVE GRANTED TO GOD, and by this present charter\\nhave confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity, that the English\\nChurch shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished, and its\\nliberties unimpaired. That we wish this so to be observed, appears\\nfrom the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of the\\npresent dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by\\ncharter the freedom of the Church\\'s elections - a right reckoned to be\\nof the greatest necessity and importance to it - and caused this to be\\nconfirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe ourselves,\\nand desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity.\\n\\nTO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted, for us and our\\nheirs for ever, all the liberties written out below, to have and to\\nkeep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs:\\n\\n(2) If any earl, baron, or other person that holds lands directly of\\nthe Crown, for military service, shall die, and at his death his heir\\nshall be of full age and owe a `relief\\', the heir shall have his\\ninheritance on payment of the ancient scale of `relief\\'. That is to\\nsay, the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay 100 for the entire earl\\'s\\nbarony, the heir or heirs of a knight 100s. at most for the entire\\nknight\\'s `fee\\', and any man that owes less shall pay less, in\\naccordance with the ancient usage of `fees\\'\\n\\n(3) But if the heir of such a person is under age and a ward, when he\\ncomes of age he shall have his inheritance without `relief\\' or fine.\\n\\n(4) The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall take\\nfrom it only reasonable revenues, customary dues, and feudal services.\\nHe shall do this without destruction or damage to men or property. If\\nwe have given the guardianship of the land to a sheriff, or to any\\nperson answerable to us for the revenues, and he commits destruction\\nor damage, we will exact compensation from him, and the land shall be\\nentrusted to two worthy and prudent men of the same `fee\\', who shall\\nbe answerable to us for the revenues, or to the person to whom we have\\nassigned them. If we have given or sold to anyone the guardianship of\\nsuch land, and he causes destruction or damage, he shall lose the\\nguardianship of it, and it shall be handed over to two worthy and\\nprudent men of the same `fee\\', who shall be similarly answerable to\\nus.\\n\\n(5) For so long as a guardian has guardianship of such land, he shall\\nmaintain the houses, parks, fish preserves, ponds, mills, and\\neverything else pertaining to it, from the revenues of the land\\nitself. When the heir comes of age, he shall restore the whole land to\\nhim, stocked with plough teams and such implements of husbandry as the\\nseason demands and the revenues from the land can reasonably bear.\\n\\n(6) Heirs may be given in marriage, but not to someone of lower social\\nstanding. Before a marriage takes place, it shall be\\' made known to\\nthe heir\\'s next-of-kin.\\n\\n(7) At her husband\\'s death, a widow may have her marriage portion and\\ninheritance at once and without trouble. She shall pay nothing for her\\ndower, marriage portion, or any inheritance that she and her husband\\nheld jointly on the day of his death. She may remain in her husband\\'s\\nhouse for forty days after his death, and within this period her dower\\nshall be assigned to her.\\n\\n(8) No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes to\\nremain without a husband. But she must give security that she will not\\nmarry without royal consent, if she holds her lands of the Crown, or\\nwithout the consent of whatever other lord she may hold them of.\\n\\n(9) Neither we nor our officials will seize any land or rent in\\npayment of a debt, so long as the debtor has movable goods sufficient\\nto discharge the debt. A debtor\\'s sureties shall not be distrained\\nupon so long as the debtor himself can discharge his debt. If, for\\nlack of means, the debtor is unable to discharge his debt, his\\nsureties shall be answerable for it. If they so desire, they may have\\nthe debtor\\'s lands and rents until they have received satisfaction for\\nthe debt that they paid for him, unless the debtor can show that he\\nhas settled his obligations to them.\\n\\n(10) If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies before\\nthe debt has been repaid, his heir shall pay no interest on the debt\\nfor so long as he remains under age, irrespective of whom he holds his\\nlands. If such a debt falls into the hands of the Crown, it will take\\nnothing except the principal sum specified in the bond.\\n\\n(11) If a man dies owing money to Jews, his wife may have her dower\\nand pay nothing towards the debt from it. If he leaves children that\\nare under age, their needs may also be provided for on a scale\\nappropriate to the size of his holding of lands. The debt is to be\\npaid out of the residue, reserving the service due to his feudal lords.\\nDebts owed to persons other than Jews are to be dealt with similarly.\\n\\n(12) No `scutage\\' or `aid\\' may be levied in our kingdom without its\\ngeneral consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to make\\nour eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our eldest daughter. For\\nthese purposes only a reasonable `aid\\' may be levied. `Aids\\' from the\\ncity of London are to be treated similarly.\\n\\n(13) The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and\\nfree customs, both by land and by water. We also will and grant that\\nall other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall enjoy all their\\nliberties and free customs.\\n\\n (14) To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment\\nof an `aid\\' - except in the three cases specified above - or a\\n`scutage\\', we will cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and\\ngreater barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those who\\nhold lands directly of us we will cause a general summons to be\\nissued, through the sheriffs and other officials, to come together on\\na fixed day (of which at least forty days notice shall be given) and\\nat a fixed place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summons\\nwill be stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointed\\nfor the day shall go forward in accordance with the resolution of\\nthose present, even if not all those who were summoned have appeared.\\n\\n(15) In future we will allow no one to levy an `aid\\' from his free\\nmen, except to ransom his person, to make his eldest son a knight, and\\n(once) to marry his eldest daughter. For these purposes only a\\nreasonable `aid\\' may be levied.\\n\\n(16) No man shall be forced to perform more service for a knight\\'s\\n`fee\\', or other free holding of land, than is due from it.\\n\\n(17) Ordinary lawsuits shall not follow the royal court around, but\\nshall be held in a fixed place.\\n\\n(18) Inquests of novel disseisin, mort d\\'ancestor, and darrein\\npresentment shall be taken only in their proper county court. We\\nourselves, or in our absence abroad our chief justice, will send two\\njustices to each county four times a year, and these justices, with\\nfour knights of the county elected by the county itself, shall hold\\nthe assizes in the county court, on the day and in the place where the\\ncourt meets.\\n\\n(19) If any assizes cannot be taken on the day of the county court, as\\nmany knights and freeholders shall afterwards remain behind, of those\\nwho have attended the court, as will suffice for the administration of\\njustice, having regard to the volume of business to be done.\\n\\n(20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in\\nproportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence\\ncorrespondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his\\nlivelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his\\nmerchandise, and a husbandman the implements of his husbandry, if they\\nfall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be\\nimposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the\\nneighbourhood.\\n\\n(21) Earls and barons shall be fined only by their equals, and in\\nproportion to the gravity of their offence.\\n\\n(22) A fine imposed upon the lay property of a clerk in holy orders\\nshall be assessed upon the same principles, without reference to the\\nvalue of his ecclesiastical benefice.\\n\\n(23) No town or person shall be forced to build bridges over rivers\\nexcept those with an ancient obligation to do so.\\n\\n(24) No sheriff, constable, coroners, or other royal officials are to\\nhold lawsuits that should be held by the royal justices.\\n\\n(25) Every county, hundred, wapentake, and tithing shall remain at\\nits ancient rent, without increase, except the royal demesne manors.\\n\\n(26) If at the death of a man who holds a lay `fee\\' of the Crown, a\\nsheriff or royal official produces royal letters patent of summons for\\na debt due to the Crown, it shall be lawful for them to seize and list\\nmovable goods found in the lay `fee\\' of the dead man to the value of\\nthe debt, as assessed by worthy men. Nothing shall be removed until\\nthe whole debt is paid, when the residue shall be given over to the\\nexecutors to carry out the dead man\\'s will. If no debt is due to the\\nCrown, all the movable goods shall be regarded as the property of the\\ndead man, except the reasonable shares of his wife and children.\\n\\n(27) If a free man dies intestate, his movable goods are to be\\ndistributed by his next-of-kin and friends, under the supervision of\\nthe Church. The rights of his debtors are to be preserved.\\n\\n(28) No constable or other royal official shall take corn or other\\nmovable goods from any man without immediate payment, unless the\\nseller voluntarily offers postponement of this.\\n\\n(29) No constable may compel a knight to pay money for castle-guard if\\nthe knight is willing to undertake the guard in person, or with\\nreasonable excuse to supply some other fit man to do it. A knight\\ntaken or sent on military service shall be excused from castle-guard\\nfor the period of this service.\\n\\n(30) No sheriff, royal official, or other person shall take horses or\\ncarts for transport from any free man, without his consent.\\n\\n(31) Neither we nor any royal official will take wood for our castle,\\nor for any other purpose, without the consent of the owner.\\n\\n(32) We will not keep the lands of people convicted of felony in our\\nhand for longer than a year and a day, after which they shall be\\nreturned to the lords of the `fees\\' concerned.\\n\\n(33) All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, and\\nthroughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast.\\n\\n(34) The writ called precipe shall not in future be issued to anyone\\nin respect of any holding of land, if a free man could thereby be\\ndeprived of the right of trial in his own lord\\'s court.\\n\\n(35) There shall be standard measures of wine, ale, and corn (the\\nLondon quarter), throughout the kingdom. There shall also be a\\nstandard width of dyed cloth, russett, and haberject, namely two ells\\nwithin the selvedges. Weights are to be standardised similarly.\\n\\n(36) In future nothing shall be paid or accepted for the issue of a\\nwrit of inquisition of life or limbs. It shall be given gratis, and\\nnot refused.\\n\\n(37) If a man holds land of the Crown by `fee-farm\\', `socage\\', or\\n`burgage\\', and also holds land of someone else for knight\\'s service,\\nwe will not have guardianship of his heir, nor of the land that\\nbelongs to the other person\\'s `fee\\', by virtue of the `fee-farm\\',\\n`socage\\', or `burgage\\', unless the `fee-farm\\' owes knight\\'s service.\\nWe will not have the guardianship of a man\\'s heir, or of land that he\\nholds of someone else, by reason of any small property that he may\\nhold of the Crown for a service of knives, arrows, or the like.\\n\\n(38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own\\nunsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the\\ntruth of it.\\n\\n(39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his\\nrights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his\\nstanding in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him,\\nor send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals\\nor by the law of the land.\\n\\n(40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.\\n\\n(41) All merchants may enter or leave England unharmed and without\\nfear, and may stay or travel within it, by land or water, for purposes\\nof trade, free from all illegal exactions, in accordance with ancient\\nand lawful customs. This, however, does not apply in time of war to\\nmerchants from a country that is at war with us. Any such merchants\\nfound in our country at the outbreak of war shall be detained without\\ninjury to their persons or property, until we or our chief justice\\nhave discovered how our own merchants are being treated in the country\\nat war with us. If our own merchants are safe they shall be safe too.\\n\\n(42) In future it shall be lawful for any man to leave and return to\\nour kingdom unharmed and without fear, by land or water, preserving\\nhis allegiance to us, except in time of war, for some short period,\\nfor the common benefit of the realm. People that have been imprisoned\\nor outlawed in accordance with the law of the land, people from a\\ncountry that is at war with us, and merchants - who shall be dealt\\nwith as stated above - are excepted from this provision.\\n\\n(43) If a man holds lands of any `escheat\\' such as the `honour\\' of\\nWallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other `escheats\\'\\nin our hand that are baronies, at his death his heir shall give us\\nonly the `relief\\' and service that he would have made to the baron,\\nhad the barony been in the baron\\'s hand. We will hold the `escheat\\' in\\nthe same manner as the baron held it.\\n\\n(44) People who live outside the forest need not in future appear\\nbefore the royal justices of the forest in answer to general\\nsummonses, unless they are actually involved in proceedings or are\\nsureties for someone who has been seized for a forest offence.\\n\\n(45) We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or other\\nofficials, only men that know the law of the realm and are minded to\\nkeep it well.\\n\\n(46) All barons who have founded abbeys, and have charters of English\\nkings or ancient tenure as evidence of this, may have guardianship of\\nthem when there is no abbot, as is their due.\\n\\n(47) All forests that have been created in our reign shall at once be\\ndisafforested. River-banks that have been enclosed in our reign shall\\nbe treated similarly.\\n\\n(48) All evil customs relating to forests and warrens, foresters,\\nwarreners, sheriffs and their servants, or river-banks and their\\nwardens, are at once to be investigated in every county by twelve\\nsworn knights of the county, and within forty days of their enquiry\\nthe evil customs are to be abolished completely and irrevocably. But\\nwe, or our chief justice if we are not in England, are first to be\\ninformed.\\n\\n(49) We will at once return all hostages and charters delivered up\\nto us by Englishmen as security for peace or for loyal service.\\n***here were some strange characters, not completely removed\\n\\n(50) We will remove completely from their offices the kinsmen of\\nGerard de Ath, Peter, Guy, and Andrew de Chanceaux, Guy de Cigogne, and in\\nfuture they shall hold no offices in England. The\\npeople in question are Engelard de Cigogn, Geoffrey de Martigny and his\\nbrothers, Philip Marc and his brothers, with Geoffrey his nephew,\\nand all their followers.\\n\\n* As soon as peace is restored, we will remove from the kingdom all\\nthe foreign knights, bowmen, their attendants, and the mercenaries\\nthat have come to it, to its harm, with horses and arms.\\n\\n* To any man whom we have deprived or dispossessed of lands,\\ncastles, liberties, or rights, without the lawful judgement of his\\nequals, we will at once restore these. In cases of dispute the\\nmatter shall be resolved by the judgement of the twenty-five\\nbarons referred to below in the clause for securing the peace. In\\ncases, however, where a man was deprived or dispossessed of\\nsomething without the lawful judgement of his equals by our father\\nKing Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in our\\nhands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have\\nrespite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a\\nlawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,\\nbefore we took the Cross as a Crusader. On our return from the\\nCrusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once render justice in\\nfull.\\n\\n* We shall have similar respite in rendering justice in connexion\\nwith forests that are to be disafforested, or to remain forests,\\nwhen these were first aforested by our father Henry or our brother\\nRichard; with the guardianship of lands in another persons fee,\\nwhen we have hitherto had this by virtue of a fee held of us for\\nknights service by a third party; and with abbeys founded in\\nanother persons fee, in which the lord of the fee claims to own a\\nright. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we\\nwill at once do full justice to complaints about these matters.\\n\\n* No one shall be arrested or imprisoned on the appeal of a woman\\nfor the death of any person except her husband.\\n\\n* All fines that have been given to us unjustly and against the law\\nof the land, and all fines that we have exacted unjustly, shall be\\nentirely remitted or the matter decided by a majority judgement of\\nthe twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause for\\nsecuring the peace together with Stephen, archbishop of\\nCanterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he wishes to\\nbring with him. If the archbishop cannot be present, proceedings\\nshall continue without him, provided that if any of the\\ntwenty-five barons has been involved in a similar suit himself,\\nhis judgement shall be set aside, and someone else chosen and\\nsworn in his place, as a substitute for the single occasion, by\\nthe rest of the twenty-five.\\n\\n* If we have deprived or dispossessed any Welshmen of lands,\\nliberties, or anything else in England or in Wales, without the\\nlawful judgement of their equals, these are at once to be returned\\nto them. A dispute on this point shall be determined in the\\nMarches by the judgement of equals. English law shall apply to\\nholdings of land in England, Welsh law to those in Wales, and the\\nlaw of the Marches to those in the Marches. The Welsh shall treat\\nus and ours in the same way.\\n\\n* In cases where a Welshman was deprived or dispossessed of\\nanything, without the lawful judgement of his equals, by our\\nfather King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in\\nour hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have\\nrespite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a\\nlawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,\\nbefore we took the Cross as a Crusader. But on our return from the\\nCrusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justice\\naccording to the laws of Wales and the said regions.\\n\\n* We will at once return the son of Llywelyn, all Welsh hostages,\\nand the charters delivered to us as security for the peace.\\n\\n* With regard to the return of the sisters and hostages of\\nAlexander, king of Scotland, his liberties and his rights, we will\\ntreat him in the same way as our other barons of England, unless\\nit appears from the charters that we hold from his father William,\\nformerly king of Scotland, that he should be treated otherwise.\\nThis matter shall be resolved by the judgement of his equals in\\nour court.\\n\\n* All these customs and liberties that we have granted shall be\\nobserved in our kingdom in so far as concerns our own relations\\nwith our subjects. Let all men of our kingdom, whether clergy or\\nlaymen, observe them similarly in their relations with their own\\nmen.\\n\\n***Strange characters may have ended here.\\n\\nSINCE WE HAVE GRANTED ALL THESE THINGS for God, for the better\\nordering of our kingdom, and to allay the discord that has arisen\\nbetween us and our barons, and since we desire that they shall be\\nenjoyed in their entirety, with lasting strength, for ever, we give\\nand grant to the barons the following security:\\n\\n* The barons shall elect twenty-five of their number to keep, and\\ncause to be observed with all their might, the peace and liberties\\ngranted and confirmed to them by this charter.\\n\\n* If we, our chief justice, our officials, or any of our servants\\noffend in any respect against any man, or transgress any of the\\narticles of the peace or of this security, and the offence is made\\nknown to four of the said twenty-five barons, they shall come to\\nus - or in our absence from the kingdom to the chief justice - to\\ndeclare it and claim immediate redress. If we, or in our absence\\nabroad the chief justice, make no redress within forty days,\\nreckoning from the day on which the offence was declared to us or\\nto him, the four barons shall refer the matter to the rest of the\\ntwenty-five barons, who may distrain upon and assail us in every\\nway possible, with the support of the whole community of the land,\\nby seizing our castles, lands, possessions, or anything else\\nsaving only our own person and those of the queen and our\\nchildren, until they have secured such redress as they have\\ndetermined upon. Having secured the redress, they may then resume\\ntheir normal obedience to us.\\n\\n* Any man who so desires may take an oath to obey the commands of\\nthe twenty-five barons for the achievement of these ends, and to\\njoin with them in assailing us to the utmost of his power. We give\\npublic and free permission to take this oath to any man who so\\ndesires, and at no time will we prohibit any man from taking it.\\nIndeed, we will compel any of our subjects who are unwilling to\\ntake it to swear it at our command.\\n\\n* If one of the twenty-five barons dies or leaves the country, or is\\nprevented in any other way from discharging his duties, the rest\\nof them shall choose another baron in his place, at their\\ndiscretion, who shall be duly sworn in as they were.\\n\\n* In the event of disagreement among the twenty-five barons on any\\nmatter referred to them for decision, the verdict of the majority\\npresent shall have the same validity as a unanimous verdict of the\\nwhole twenty-five, whether these were all present or some of those\\nsummoned were unwilling or unable to appear.\\n\\n* The twenty-five barons shall swear to obey all the above articles\\nfaithfully, and shall cause them to be obeyed by others to the\\nbest of their power.\\n\\n* We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own efforts\\nor those of a third party, anything by which any part of these\\nconcessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished. Should\\nsuch a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will at\\nno time make use of it, either ourselves or through a third party.\\n\\nWe have remitted and pardoned fully to all men any ill-will, hurt, or\\ngrudges that have arisen between us and our subjects, whether clergy\\nor laymen, since the beginning of the dispute.\\nWe have in addition remitted fully, and for our own part have also\\npardoned, to all clergy and laymen any offences committed as a result\\nof the said dispute between Easter 1215 AD and the restoration of\\npeace.\\n\\nIn addition we have caused letters patent to be made for the barons,\\nbearing witness to this security and to the concessions set out above,\\nover the seals of Stephen archbishop of Canterbury, Henry archbishop\\nof Dublin, the other bishops named above, and Master Pandulf.\\n\\nIT IS ACCORDINGLY OUR WISH AND COMMAND that the English Church shall\\nbe free, and that men in our kingdom shall have and keep all these\\nliberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably in their\\nfulness and entirety for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs, in\\nall things and all places for ever.\\n\\nBoth we and the barons have sworn that all this shall be observed in\\ngood faith and without deceit. Witness the above mentioned people and\\nmany others.\\n\\nGiven by our hand in the meadow that is called Runnymede, between\\nWindsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of June in the seventeenth\\nyear of our reign.\\n\\n***\\n\\n[There were many missing spaces in this one, not sure I got them all]\\n\\nMagna Carta 1215\\n\\nJohn, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of\\nNormandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishops,\\nbishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciars, foresters, sheriffs,\\nstewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects,\\ngreeting. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of our\\nsoul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor of\\nGod and the advancement of holy church, and for the reform of\\nour realm, by advice of our venerable fathers, Stephen archbishop of\\nCanterbury, primate of all England and cardinal of the holy Roman\\nChurch, Henry archbishop of Dublin, William of London, Peter of\\nWinchester, Jocelyn of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of\\nWorcester, William of Coventry, Benedict of Rochester, bishops; of\\nmaster Pandulf, subdeacon and member of the household of our lord the\\nPope, of brother Aymeric (master of the Knights of the Temple in\\nEngland), and of the illustrious men William Marshall earl of Pembroke,\\nWilliam earl of Salisbury, William earl of Warenne, William earl\\nof Arundel, Alan of Galloway (constable of Scotland), Waren Fitz\\nGerald, Peter Fits Herbert, Hubert de Burgh (seneschal of Poitou), Hugh\\nde Neville, Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip\\nd\\'Aubigny, Robert of Roppesley, John Marshall, John Fitz Hugh, and\\nothers, our liegemen.\\n\\n1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present\\ncharter confirmed for us and our heirs for ever that the English church\\nshall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties\\ninviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent from\\nthis that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned most important\\nand very essential to the English church, we, of our pure and\\nunconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm and did\\nobtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope Innocent\\nIII., before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this we\\nwill observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith by our\\nheirs for ever. We have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom, for\\nus and our heirs for ever, all the underwritten liberties, to be had\\nand held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs for ever.\\n\\n2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief by\\nmilitary service shall have died, and at the time of his death his heir\\nshall be of full age and owe \"relief\" he shall have his inheritance on\\npayment of the ancient relief, namely the heir or heirs of an earl, 100\\npounds for a whole earl\\'s barony; the heir or heirs of a baron, 100\\npounds for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100 shillings\\nat most for a whole knight\\'s fee; and whoever owes less let him give\\nless, according to the ancient custom officers.\\n\\n3. If, however, the heir of any of the aforesaid has been under age\\nand in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief and\\nwithout fine when he comes of age.\\n\\n4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shall\\ntake from the land of the heir nothing but reasonably produce,\\nreasonable customs, and reasonable services, and that without\\ndestruction or waste of men or goods; and if we have committed the\\nwardship of the lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to any other\\nwho is responsible to us for its issues, and he has made destruction or\\nwaste of what he holds in wardship, we will take of him amends, and the\\nland shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men of that fee, who\\nshall be responsible for the issues to us or to him to whom we\\nshall assign them; and if we have given or sold the wardship of any\\nsuch land to anyone and he has there in made destruction or waste, he\\nshall lose that wardship, and it shall be transferred to two lawful and\\ndiscreet men of that fief, who shall be responsible to us in like\\nmanner as aforesaid.\\n\\n5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,\\nshall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and other\\nthings pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; and\\nhe shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all his\\nland, stocked with ploughs and \"waynage,\" according as the season of\\nhusbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonably bear.\\n\\n6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before the\\nmarriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have notice.\\n\\n7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith and\\nwithout difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor shall\\nshe give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or for\\nthe inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the death\\nof that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband for\\nfourty days after his death, within which time her dower shall be\\nassigned to her.\\n\\n8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers to\\nlive without a husband; provided always that she gives security not to\\nmarry without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consent\\nof the lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.\\n\\n9. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall seize any land or rent for any\\ndebt, so long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repay the\\ndebt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long as the\\nprincipal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if the principal\\ndebtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewith to pay it,\\nthen the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let them have the\\nlands and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, until they are\\nindemnified for the debt which they have paid for him, unless the\\nprincipal debtor can show proof that he is discharged thereof as\\nagainst the said sureties.\\n\\n10. If one who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great or small, die\\nbefore that loan can be repaid, the debt shall not bear interest while\\nthe heir is under age, of whomsoever he may hold; and if the debt fall\\ninto our hands, we will not take anything except the principal sum\\ncontained in the bond.\\n\\n11. And if any one die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her\\ndower and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of the deceased\\nare left underage, necessaries shall be provided for them in keeping\\nwith the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue the debt shall\\nbe paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords; in like\\nmanner let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.\\n\\n12. No scutage nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by\\ncommon counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for\\nmaking our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest\\ndaughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than a\\nreasonable aid. In like manner it shall be done concerning aids from\\nthe city of London.\\n\\n13. And the city of London shall have all its ancient liberties and\\nfree customs, as well by land as by water; furthermore, we decree and\\ngrant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall have all\\ntheir liberties and free customs.\\n\\n14. And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent the\\nassessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a\\nscutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots,\\nearls, and greater barons, severally by our letters; and we will\\nmoreover cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and\\nbailiffs, all others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed date, namely,\\nafter the expiry of at least forty days, and at a fixed place; and in\\nall letters of such summons we will specify the reason of the summons.\\nAnd when the summons has thus been made, the business shall proceed on\\nthe day appointed, according to the counsel of such as are present,\\nalthough not all who were summoned have come.\\n\\n15. We will not for the future grant to any one license to take an aid\\nfrom his own free tenants, except to ransom his body, to make his\\neldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and on\\neach of these occasions there shall be levied only a reasonable aid.\\n\\n16. No one shall be distrained for performance of greater service for\\na knight\\'s fee, or for any other free tenement, than is due therefrom.\\n\\n17. Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be held in some\\nfixed place.\\n\\n18. Inquests of novel disseisin, of mort d\\'ancester, and of darrein\\npresentment, shall not be held elsewhere than in their own county\\ncourts and that in manner following,--We, or, if we should be out of\\nthe realm, our chief justiciar, will send two justiciars through\\nevery county four times a year, who shall, along with four knights of\\nthe county chosen by the county, hold the said assize in the county\\ncourt, on the day and in the place of meeting of that court.\\n\\n19. And if any of the said assizes cannot be taken on the day of the\\ncounty court, let there remain of the knights and freeholders, who were\\npresent at the county court on that day, as many as may be required for\\nthe efficient making of judgments, according as the business be more or\\nless.\\n\\n20. A freeman shall not be amerced for a slight offense, except in\\naccordance with the degree of the offense; and for a grave offense he\\nshall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of the offense, yet\\nsaving always his \"contentment;\" and a merchant in the same way, saving\\nhis \"merchandise;\" and a villein shall be amerced in the same way,\\nsaving his \"wainage\"--if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of\\nthe aforesaid amercements shall be impsed except by the oath of honest\\nmen of the neighborhood.\\n\\n21. Earls and barons shall not be amerced except through their peers,\\nand only in accordance with the degree of the offense.\\n\\n22.

All counties, hundreds, wapentakes, and trithings (except our\\ndemesne manors) shall remain at old rents, and without any additional\\npayment.***here may be an error\\n\\n26. If any one holding of us a lay fief shall die, and our sheriff or\\nbailiff shall exhibit our letters patent of summons for a debt which\\nthe deceased owed to us, it shall be lawful for our sheriff or bailiff\\nto attach and catalogue chattels of the deceased, found upon the lay\\nfief, to the value of that debt, at the sight of law-worthy men,\\nprovided always that nothing whatever be then be removed until the debt\\nwhich is evident shall be fully paid to us; and the residue shall be\\nleft to the executors to fulfil the will of the deceased; and if there\\nbe nothing due from him to us, all the chattels shall go to\\nthe deceased, saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares.\\n\\n27.

No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or other\\nprovisions from any one without immediately tendering money therefor,\\nunless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.\\n\\n29. No constable shall compel any knight to give money in lieu\\nof castle-guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or\\n(if he cannot do it from any reasonable cause) then by another\\nresponsible man. Further, if we have led or sent him upon military\\nservice, he shall be relieved from guard in proportion to the time\\nduring which he has been on service because of us.\\n\\n30.

All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and\\nentry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as\\nwell by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and\\nright customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such\\nmerchants as are of the land at war with us. And if such are found in\\nour land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without\\ninjury to their bodies or goods, until information be received by us,\\nor by our chief justiciar, how the merchants of our land found in the\\nland at war with us are treated; and if our men are safe there, the\\nothers shall be safe in our land.\\n\\n42.

If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties,\\nor other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in England\\nor in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if a\\ndispute arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by the\\njudgment of their peers; for tenements in England according to the law\\nof England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales, and\\nfor tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches.\\nWelshmen shall do the same to us and ours.\\n\\n57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,\\nwithout the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed by\\nKing Henry our father or King Richard our brother, and which we retain\\nin our hand (or which are possessed by others, to whom we are bound to\\nwarrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term of crusaders;\\nexcepting those things about which a plea has been raised or an inquest\\nmade by our order before we took the cross; but as soon as we return\\n(or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will immediately\\ngrant full justice in accordance with the laws of the Welsh and in\\nrelation to the foresaid regions.\\n\\n58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all the\\nhostages of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for the\\npeace.\\n\\n59. We will do toward Alexander, King of Scots, concerning the return\\nof his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, and his\\nright, in the same manner as we shall do toward our other barons of\\nEngland, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charters\\nwhich we hold from William his father, formerly King of Scots; and this\\nshall be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.\\n\\n60. Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, the\\nobservance of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains\\nto us toward our men, shall be observed by all of our kingdom, as well\\nclergy as laymen, as far as pertains to them toward their men.\\n\\n61. Since, moreover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for\\nthe better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and our\\nbarons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that they\\nshould enjoy them in complete and firm endurance for ever, we give and\\ngrant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons choose\\nfive-and-twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will, who shall\\nbe bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and cause to be\\nobserved, the peace and liberties we have granted and confirmed to them\\nby this our present Charter, so that if we, or our justiciar, or our\\nbailiffs or any one of our officers, shall in anything be at fault\\ntoward any one, or shall have broken any one of the articles of\\nthe peace or of this security, and the offense be notified to four\\nbarons of the foresaid five-and-twenty, the said four barons shall\\nrepair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of the realm) and, laying\\nthe transgression before us, petition to have that transgression\\nredressed without delay. And if we shall not have corrected the\\ntransgression (or, in the event of our being out of the realm, if our\\njusticiar shall not have corrected it) within forty days, reckoning\\nfrom the time it has been intimated to us (or to our justiciar, if\\nwe should be out of the realm), the four barons aforesaid shall refer\\nthat matter to the rest of the five-and-twenty barons, and those\\nfive-and-twenty barons shall, together with the community of the whole\\nland, distrain and distress us in all possible ways, namely, by seizing\\nour castles, lands, possessions, and in any other way they can, until\\nredress has been obtained as they deem fit, saving harmless our own\\nperson, and the persons of our queen and children; and when redress has\\nbeen obtained, they shall resume their old relations toward us. And let\\nwhoever in the country desires it, swear to obey the orders of the said\\nfive-and-twenty barons for the execution of all the aforesaid matters,\\nand along with them, to molest us to the utmost of his power; and we\\npublicly and freely grant leave to every one who wishes to swear, and\\nwe shall never forbid any one to swear. All those, moreover, in the\\nland who of themselves and of their own accord are unwilling to swear\\nto the twenty-five to help them in constraining and molesting us, we\\nshall by our command compel the same to swear to the effect aforesaid.\\nAnd if any one of the five-and-twenty barons shall have died or\\ndeparted from the land, or be incapacitated in any other manner which\\nwould prevent the foresaid provisions being carried out, those of\\nthe said twenty-five barons who are left shall choose another in his\\nplace according to their own judgment, and he shall be sworn in the\\nsame way as the others. Further, in all matters, the execution of which\\nis intrusted to these twenty-five barons, if perchance these\\ntwenty-five are present, that which the majority of those present\\nordain or command shall be held as fixed and established, exactly as if\\nthe whole twenty-five had concurred in this; and the said twenty-five\\nshall swear that they will faithfully observe all that is aforesaid,\\nand cause it to be observed with all their might. And we shall procure\\nnothing from any one, directly or indirectly, whereby any part of\\nthese concessions and liberties might be revoked or diminished; and if\\nany such thing has been procured, let it be void and null, and we shall\\nnever use it personally or by another.\\n\\n62. And all the ill-will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen\\nbetween us and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel,\\nwe have completely remitted and pardoned every one. Moreover, all\\ntrespasses occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the sixteenth\\nyear of our reign till the restoration of peace, we have fully remitted\\nto all, both clergy and laymen, and completely forgiven, as far as\\npertains to us. And, on this head, we have caused to be made for them\\nletters testimonial patent of the lord Stephen, archbishop of\\nCanterbury, of the lord Henry, archbishop of Dublin, of the bishops\\naforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as touching this security and\\nthe concessions aforesaid.\\n\\n63. Wherefore it is our will, and we firmly enjoin, that the English\\nChurch be free, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the\\naforesaid liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably,\\nfreely and quietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs,\\nof us and our heirs, in all respects and in all places for ever, as is\\naforesaid. An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as on\\nthe part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall be\\nkept in good faith and without evil intent. Given under our hand--the\\nabove-named and many others being witnesses--in the meadow which is\\ncalled Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of\\nJune, in the seventeenth year of our reign.\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nThe text of THE MAGNA CARTA\\n\\n\\nThe Magna Carta (The Great Charter):\\n\\nPreamble:\\n\\n\\nJohn, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of\\nNormandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishop,\\nbishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs,\\nstewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects,\\ngreetings.  Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of\\nour soul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor\\nof God and the advancement of his holy Church and for the rectifying\\nof our realm, we have granted as underwritten by advice of our\\nvenerable fathers, Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all\\nEngland and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry, archbishop of\\nDublin, William of London, Peter of Winchester, Jocelyn of Bath and\\nGlastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of Worcester, William of\\nCoventry, Benedict of Rochester, bishops; of Master Pandulf, subdeacon\\nand member of the household of our lord the Pope, of brother Aymeric\\n(master of the Knights of the Temple in England), and of the\\nillustrious men William Marshal, earl of Pembroke, William, earl of\\nSalisbury, William, earl of Warenne, William, earl of Arundel, Alan of\\nGalloway (constable of Scotland), Waren Fitz Gerold, Peter Fitz\\nHerbert, Hubert De Burgh (seneschal of Poitou), Hugh de Neville,\\nMatthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip d\\'Aubigny,\\nRobert of Roppesley, John Marshal, John Fitz Hugh, and others, our\\nliegemen.\\n\\n\\n1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present\\ncharter confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English Church\\nshall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties\\ninviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent\\nfrom this that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned most\\nimportant and very essential to the English Church, we, of our pure\\nand unconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm and\\ndid obtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope Innocent\\nIII, before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this we\\nwill observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith by our\\nheirs forever.  We have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom,\\nfor us and our heirs forever, all the underwritten liberties, to be\\nhad and held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs forever.\\n\\n2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief by\\nmilitary service shall have died, and at the time of his death his\\nheir shall be full of age and owe \"relief\", he shall have his\\ninheritance by the old relief, to wit, the heir or heirs of an earl,\\nfor the whole baroncy of an earl by L100; the heir or heirs of a\\nbaron, L100 for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100s,\\nat most, and whoever owes less let him give less, according to the\\nancient custom of fees.\\n\\n\\n3. If, however, the heir of any one of the aforesaid has been under\\nage and in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief and\\nwithout fine when he comes of age.\\n\\n4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shall\\ntake from the land of the heir nothing but reasonable produce,\\nreasonable customs, and reasonable services, and that without\\ndestruction or waste of men or goods; and if we have committed the\\nwardship of the lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to any\\nother who is responsible to us for its issues, and he has made\\ndestruction or waster of what he holds in wardship, we will take of\\nhim amends, and the land shall be committed to two lawful and discreet\\nmen of that fee, who shall be responsible for the issues to us or to\\nhim to whom we shall assign them; and if we have given or sold the\\nwardship of any such land to anyone and he has therein made\\ndestruction or waste, he shall lose that wardship, and it shall be\\ntransferred to two lawful and discreet men of that fief, who shall be\\nresponsible to us in like manner as aforesaid.\\n\\n\\n5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,\\nshall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and other\\nthings pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; and\\nhe shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all his\\nland, stocked with ploughs and wainage, according as the season of\\nhusbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonable\\nbear.\\n\\n6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before\\nthe marriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have\\nnotice.\\n\\n7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith and\\nwithout difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor\\nshall she give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or\\nfor the inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the\\ndeath of that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband\\nfor forty days after his death, within which time her dower shall be\\nassigned to her.\\n\\n8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers to\\nlive without a husband; provided always that she gives security not to\\nmarry without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consent\\nof the lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.\\n\\n9. Neither we nor our bailiffs will seize any land or rent for any\\ndebt, as long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repay\\nthe debt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long\\nas the principal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if the\\nprincipal debtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewith\\nto pay it, then the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let them\\nhave the lands and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, until\\nthey are indemnified for the debt which they have paid for him, unless\\nthe principal debtor can show proof that he is discharged thereof as\\nagainst the said sureties.\\n\\n10. If one who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great or small, die\\nbefore that loan be repaid, the debt shall not bear interest while the\\nheir is under age, of whomsoever he may hold; and if the debt fall\\ninto our hands, we will not take anything except the principal sum\\ncontained in the bond.\\n\\n11. And if anyone die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her\\ndower and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of the\\ndeceased are left under age, necessaries shall be provided for them in\\nkeeping with the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue the\\ndebt shall be paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords;\\nin like manner let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.\\n\\n12. No scutage not aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by\\ncommon counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for\\nmaking our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest\\ndaughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than a\\nreasonable aid.  In like manner it shall be done concerning aids from\\nthe city of London.\\n\\n13. And the city of London shall have all it ancient liberties and\\nfree customs, as well by land as by water; furthermore, we decree\\nand grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall\\nhave all their liberties and free customs.\\n\\n14. And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent the\\nassessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a\\nscutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops,\\nabbots, earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters; and we\\nwill moveover cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and\\nbailiffs, and others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed date,\\nnamely, after the expiry of at least forty days, and at a fixed place;\\nand in all letters of such summons we will specify the reason of the\\nsummons.  And when the summons has thus been made, the business shall\\nproceed on the day appointed, according to the counsel of such as are\\npresent, although not all who were summoned have come.\\n\\n15. We will not for the future grant to anyone license to take an aid\\nfrom his own free tenants, except to ransom his person, to make his\\neldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and on\\neach of these occasions there shall be levied only a reasonable aid.\\n\\n16. No one shall be distrained for performance of greater service for\\na knight\\'s fee, or for any other free tenement, than is due therefrom.\\n\\n17. Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be held in some\\nfixed place.\\n\\n18. Inquests of novel disseisin, of mort d\\'ancestor, and of darrein\\npresentment shall not be held elsewhere than in their own county\\ncourts, and that in manner following; We, or, if we should be out of\\nthe realm, our chief justiciar, will send two justiciaries through\\nevery county four times a year, who shall alone with four knights of\\nthe county chosen by the county, hold the said assizes in the county\\ncourt, on the day and in the place of meeting of that court.\\n\\n19. And if any of the said assizes cannot be taken on the day of the\\ncounty court, let there remain of the knights and freeholders, who\\nwere present at the county court on that day, as many as may be\\nrequired for the efficient making of judgments, according as the\\nbusiness be more or less.\\n\\n20. A freeman shall not be amerced for a slight offense, except in\\naccordance with the degree of the offense; and for a grave offense he\\nshall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of the offense, yet\\nsaving always his \"contentment\"; and a merchant in the same way,\\nsaving his \"merchandise\"; and a villein shall be amerced in the same\\nway, saving his \"wainage\" if they have fallen into our mercy: and none\\nof the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of\\nhonest men of the neighborhood.\\n\\n21.

All counties, hundred, wapentakes, and trithings (except our\\ndemesne manors) shall remain at the old rents, and without any\\nadditional payment.\\n\\n26. If anyone holding of us a lay fief shall die, and our sheriff or\\nbailiff shall exhibit our letters patent of summons for a debt which\\nthe deceased owed us, it shall be lawful for our sheriff or bailiff to\\nattach and enroll the chattels of the deceased, found upon the lay\\nfief, to the value of that debt, at the sight of law worthy men,\\nprovided always that nothing whatever be thence removed until the debt\\nwhich is evident shall be fully paid to us; and the residue shall be\\nleft to the executors to fulfill the will of the deceased; and if\\nthere be nothing due from him to us, all the chattels shall go to the\\ndeceased, saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares.\\n\\n27. If any freeman shall die intestate, his chattels shall be\\ndistributed by the hands of his nearest kinsfolk and friends, under\\nsupervision of the Church, saving to every one the debts which the\\ndeceased owed to him.\\n\\n28. No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or other\\nprovisions from anyone without immediately tendering money therefor,\\nunless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.\\n\\n29. No constable shall compel any knight to give money in lieu of\\ncastle-guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or\\n(if he himself cannot do it from any reasonable cause) then by another\\nresponsible man.  Further, if we have led or sent him upon military\\nservice, he shall be relieved from guard in proportion to the time\\nduring which he has been on service because of us.\\n\\n30.

Nothing in future shall be given or taken for a writ of\\ninquisition of life or limbs, but freely it shall be granted,\\nand never denied.\\n\\n37. If anyone holds of us by fee-farm, either by socage or by burage,\\nor of any other land by knight\\'s service, we will not (by reason of\\nthat fee-farm, socage, or burgage), have the wardship of the heir, or\\nof such land of his as if of the fief of that other; nor shall we have\\nwardship of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage, unless such fee-farm\\nowes knight\\'s service.

All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and\\nentry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as\\nwell by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and\\nright customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such\\nmerchants as are of the land at war with us. And if such are found in\\nour land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without\\ninjury to their bodies or goods, until information be received by us,\\nor by our chief justiciar, how the merchants of our land found in the\\nland at war with us are treated; and if our men are safe there, the\\nothers shall be safe in our land.\\n\\n42.

If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties,\\nor other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in England\\nor in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if a\\ndispute arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by the\\njudgment of their peers; for the tenements in England according to the\\nlaw of England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales,\\nand for tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches.\\nWelshmen shall do the same to us and ours.\\n\\n57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,\\nwithout the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed by\\nKing Henry our father, or King Richard our brother, and which we\\nretain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, and which we\\nought to warrant), we will have respite until the usual term of\\ncrusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised\\nor an inquest made by our order before we took the cross; but as soon\\nas we return (or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will\\nimmediately grant full justice in accordance with the laws of the\\nWelsh and in relation to the foresaid regions.\\n\\n58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all the\\nhostages of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for\\nthe peace.\\n\\n59.

Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, the\\nobservances of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains\\nto us towards our men, shall be observed b all of our kingdom, as well\\nclergy as laymen, as far as pertains to them towards their men.\\n\\n61. Since, moveover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for\\nthe better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and our\\nbarons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that they\\nshould enjoy them in complete and firm endurance forever, we give and\\ngrant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons\\nchoose five and twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will,\\nwho shall be bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and\\ncause to be observed, the peace and liberties we have granted and\\nconfirmed to them by this our present Charter, so that if we, or our\\njusticiar, or our bailiffs or any one of our officers, shall in\\nanything be at fault towards anyone, or shall have broken any one of\\nthe articles of this peace or of this security, and the offense be\\nnotified to four barons of the foresaid five and twenty, the said four\\nbarons shall repair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of the\\nrealm) and, laying the transgression before us, petition to have that\\ntransgression redressed without delay.  And if we shall not have\\ncorrected the transgression (or, in the event of our being out of the\\nrealm, if our justiciar shall not have corrected it) within forty\\ndays, reckoning from the time it has been intimated to us (or to our\\njusticiar, if we should be out of the realm), the four barons\\naforesaid shall refer that matter to the rest of the five and twenty\\nbarons, and those five and twenty barons shall, together with the\\ncommunity of the whole realm, distrain and distress us in all possible\\nways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in any\\nother way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit,\\nsaving harmless our own person, and the persons of our queen and\\nchildren; and when redress has been obtained, they shall resume their\\nold relations towards us.  And let whoever in the country desires it,\\nswear to obey the orders of the said five and twenty barons for the\\nexecution of all the aforesaid matters, and along with them, to molest\\nus to the utmost of his power; and we publicly and freely grant leave\\nto everyone who wishes to swear, and we shall never forbid anyone to\\nswear.\\n\\nAll those, moveover, in the land who of themselves and of their own\\naccord are unwilling to swear to the twenty five to help them in\\nconstraining and molesting us, we shall by our command compel the same\\nto swear to the effect foresaid.  And if any one of the five and\\ntwenty barons shall have died or departed from the land, or be\\nincapacitated in any other manner which would prevent the foresaid\\nprovisions being carried out, those of the said twenty five barons who\\nare left shall choose another in his place according to their own\\njudgment, and he shall be sworn in the same way as the others.\\nFurther, in all matters, the execution of which is entrusted to these\\ntwenty five barons, if perchance these twenty five are present and\\ndisagree about anything, or if some of them, after being summoned, are\\nunwilling or unable to be present, that which the majority of those\\npresent ordain or command shall be held as fixed and established,\\nexactly as if the whole twenty five had concurred in this; and the\\nsaid twenty five shall swear that they will faithfully observe all\\nthat is aforesaid, and cause it to be observed with all their might.\\nAnd we shall procure nothing from anyone, directly or indirectly,\\nwhereby any part of these concessions and liberties might be revoked\\nor diminished; and if any such things has been procured, let it be\\nvoid and null, and we shall never use it personally or by another.\\n\\n62. And all the will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen between\\nus and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel, we have\\ncompletely remitted and pardoned to everyone.  Moreover, all\\ntrespasses occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the\\nsixteenth year of our reign till the restoration of peace, we have\\nfully remitted to all, both clergy and laymen, and completely\\nforgiven, as far as pertains to us.  And on this head, we have caused\\nto be made for them letters testimonial patent of the lord Stephen,\\narchbishop of Canterbury, of the lord Henry, archbishop of Dublin, of\\nthe bishops aforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as touching this security\\nand the concessions aforesaid.\\n\\n63. Wherefore we will and firmly order that the English Church be\\nfree, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the aforesaid\\nliberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably, freely and\\nquietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs, of us and\\nour heirs, in all respects and in all places forever, as is\\naforesaid.  An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as\\non the part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall be\\nkept in good faith and without evil intent.  Given under our hand -\\nthe above named and many others being witnesses - in the meadow which\\nis called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day\\nof June, in the seventeenth year of our reign.\\n\\n***'"
